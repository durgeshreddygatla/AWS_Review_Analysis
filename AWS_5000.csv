For an academic course, the book serves as a base by providing definitions and explanations for a broad range of topics.  In my course, the book was used to introduce a number of topics that were discussed in further detail during class discussions, and it was supplemented by case studies, videos, and articles with more depth.

She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.

She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.

UI - at the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is ""Certified Associate,"" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.

Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.

Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.

When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.

As for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.

Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.

  What this is
  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process
  - A wonderfully designed interface
  - A great overview of using DW

What it isn't
  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)
  - An expert tips and tricks reference

All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen.

They made it very easy to navigate and find specific contents and general ease. Candyce Mairs, the teacher, gives excellent explanations and speaks clearly and at a good pace. The pace isn't too fast or too slow and I never had to rewind to listen to instructions over and over.

The course begins with the absolute basics so this is where it really breaks everything down about Dreamweaver. Being I knew most of the basics, after an hour, skipped some of it because I already knew it. The first problem I have with this training video is that you are taught to design websites from 1990. The look of them is so out dated and old its a waste of time learning it this way because anyone wanting to design a web site would not want one that looks so out dated and blah. When the videos finally get around to showing the ""CSS"" style designing, they show an example of a web site that is current in design and style. Exactly what I was wanting to learn but they don't use it for the training...WHAT? are they joking? They go back to the 1990 styled site that they show you in the beginning of these videos and TRY to update and revamp it into CSS. I wanted to focus on the CSS portion because for my needs, this is the missing info that has held me back on finally learning and make a modern web site using Dreamweaver.

The sample that they should have used to teach the CSS had many bells and whistles like when you scroll thru the site the background didn't move. The background was a great illustration photo! Then there were great drop down sub nav links that all had different colors, maps, columns, video etc. Again, all the modern bells and whistles. Yes, they do teach many of these features but in the OLD 1990 style, not in the CSS which is a complete different way of putting things into the program. I really wish they used the sample which they showed about how great CSS is. TOTAL BUMMER!!!!

I have been using Dreamweaver for about 10 years but find it's good to take a course now and then to learn more about the program.  I mostly learned by myself so it's good to learn things I wasn't aware of.

I find the instructors voice pleasant and thorough although I thought it took way too long to get down to business.  I didn't really feel like I was learning or doing anything until well into the lessons.  She also seemed to wander off course to much for my liking.

I also found that she didn't prep me well enough for each lesson by telling me what files I needed and setting up Dreamweaver for each lesson.  I was frequently going to the DVD's Assets folder to get files that were missing from the lessons.  Luckily I have been using Dreamweaver long enough to know how to troubleshoot and find the missing parts.  But I wonder if a beginner would get confused and not know what to do without careful lesson setup.

And I could swear there were a few mistakes on the lesson's end in the quiz answers at the end of each lesson.  Some questions were confusing.

I thought it was a standard video DVD.  It is in fact a program that has to be executed (without installing anything on your computer.)  I am running it on a PC workstation.  My antivirus/spyware programs have not gone off yet, so there does not seem to be any malware associated with it.

The video contains over 12 hours of video instruction, and is accompanied by a printed guide book to teach the fundamentals of Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  It also goes through some basic principles and fundamentals of web design.  The presenter (Candyce Mairs) is a clear and eloquent speaker, and is an Adobe Certified Instructor.  The video runs in the middle of the window, and you can select to have the sidebar available or hidden.

First few chapters are very basic.  It is intended for those who have little or no background/experience with the terminology, such as ""URL"" and ""domain name.""  Yeah, it's goes to the fundamentals.  I like the subtitle at the bottom of the video.  The first few chapters are so basic that I actually started writing this review while I the video is running on the other monitor (I have a dual-monitor setup).  The first chapter is dedicated to HTML fundamentals and also acts as a refresher for those who have the experience.  The second chapter is an introduction to what Dreamweaver is and what it can do.  Chapter 3 is a ""Quick Start"" chapter that gets the user setup with putting together a homepage (basic starter layouts, building the homepage, creating header area, etc.).  There are some tests at the end of each chapter to help reinforce what you've learned.

What I liked:
-This is a book designed for beginners.  As such, the first few chapters will be mostly overview and fundamentals.
-The DVD comes with a guide book.  It helps with the video, and it can be brought around so you can read it without the video.
-The course layout is logical, and therefore it makes sense.  I've seen so many poorly designed guides that jump all over the place, and this video guide is not one of these.
-Having the a ""video"" of what the speaker is talking about really helps.  You can follow what the screen should look like.
-The caption at the bottom of the video.  This was such a major positive.  A+++

What I did not like:
-The startup was not as straightforward as I expected.  Again, no big deal, but I can see how this could be a problem for those who do not know how to enable autostart, or those whose antivirus prevents the startup of an .exe file.
-The DVD could have came with the trial version of Dreamweaver.  No big deal if you have a fast internet connection, but I know a few people who are stuck with a slow DSL speed.

In the end, you'll be familiar with the program's interface, and hopfully you will learn how to use the essential commands and tools to create and design websites.  It also identifies some areas that are typically and easily overlooked.

The book (printed guide) is glued onto the packaging with those sticky gel dots.  Though it can be separated from the box, it was not immediately obvious and I ended up carrying the entire package with me.  I wish the book was kept separated or maybe in a pocket.  No big deal.

Overall, it is a nice beginner's guide to becoming familiar with and using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  Highly recommended.",A very good video course to learn the basics of Dreamweaver,1295913600,2,

Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.

The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.

I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.

HOWEVER, if you are a complete novice then this disc will teach you a lot. Just be prepared for a very very slow pace. If you've never designed a web page then this may get you started but it will probably leave you lost after a while, because although she spends a lot of time explaining things almost as elementary as how to use a mouse, she does not cover much of the most basic web design fundamentals you would get in a beginning course at a school. And you will only be shown extremely childish examples of actual visual design and layout of web pages. If you have designed a web page before, then there is probably 30 minutes of material at the end of the course that will be useful, and if you don't mind clawing your eyes out in frustration then you could take the time to watch some of the earlier lessons to learn about the Dreamweaver interface. However, as another reviewer noted, there is not detailed index, so you will spend a lot of time skipping through lessons to find the salient parts. There are many ""lessons"" where all she does is talk about what she is going to teach you in the next lesson, i.e. teaching you nothing.

I used to code basic HTML by hand, but never learned CSS, so I wanted to learn it with this tutorial. I expected that to be part of the lessons but obviously not the majority. I also got Dreamweaver a while ago but haven't used it in years. I was patient at first, but then after a few hours of the most basic interface issues being hounded upon over and over again, I started skipping through lessons. And the author doesn't just give detailed lessons on how to use the Dreamweaver interface; she also goes in-depth to describe how to use basic OS functionality. Add to that her awkward, stilted speech and nasal voice (I'm not trying to be mean, but it just isn't professional), and I was pulling my hair out, even when listening to the lessons that I was interested in.

Examples:

* The bottom 10px of so of the screen in the videos is cut off, so that sometimes the narrator is referring
  to something she's doing, but her cursor and what she's clicking on are not visible on the screen. In addition
  there is a LARGE ""video2brain"" watermark obscuring some of the vital controls in the bottom right corner of the
  screen, once again making it impossible to understand exactly what she is doing in the Dreamweaver interface.

* An entire lesson (3:30 min) spent explaining how to create a new folder on your hard drive and change it's name.

* Several minutes spent explaining how to open and close palettes and windows in Dreamweaver. (Not rocket science.)

* Way too much time spent explaining basic OS/Browser functionality: Save/Save As functions, untitled documents,
  naming HTML files, where page titles display on a browser window, how to bookmark sites in a browser and how
  browser tabs work. None of this begins to expain how to use Dreamweaver, let alone build a web page.

* The history of meta tags, featuring the quote ""It's a meta tag because it has HTML brackets and it says 'meta'.""

* An entire lesson (6.4) explaining how to select, copy and paste text -- elementary OS functionality. Really,
  noting to do with Dreamweaver here! I'm not exaggerating. That was the lesson.

* 5 minutes spent on making bold or italic text (not an exaggeration). Not via CSS either, just regular ""strong""
  and ""i"" tags, and using the clickable buttons [B] [I] to set them in Dreamweaver.

* Time spent explaining how those little triangles on drop-down menus indicate that they are a menu with choices
  that can be accessed. Didn't the first Mac television commercial in 1984 already cover that subject in-depth?
  Or was that the Minesweeper tutorial?

* Time wasted explaining how to select all text. Not something tricky about how to select text and not catch code
  characters by mistake, just valuable time spent explaining that you could hit control-A to select all.

* Six minutes and thirty seconds spent explaining what the different types of HTML links are. Not HOW to create them.
  Not anything about styling them, or using javascript with them, or anything fancy like that. More than SIX MINUTES
  explaining that you can have a basic hyperlink or an anchor link, perhaps talking about relative vs. absolute URL paths.

* An example of her slow, wordy manner of speech. She adds 20px margin to something. Rather than saying ""that will
  now add 20px around all sides of the object,"" instead she says it ""adds 20px to the right...the bottom...the left...
  and the top edges."" Now imagine that statement taking 10 seconds to utter.

* The booklet is glued inside the box that the DVD comes in, so it is very inconvenient to reference or read
  (bulky and inflexible).

This video was quite obviously not scripted. The narrator makes several flubs throughout and laughs about them. She CONSTANTLY repeats herself from one lesson to another, which wouldn't be so bad if it was just a reference to what she taught us in a former lesson, but she invariably re-teaches that lesson again, so that you are begging on your hands and knees to be taught something new, anything! If you want to see an example of the author's web design capacity, take a look at my screen capture added to the product photos, taken from this DVD, where she shows a picture of her personal website which apparently has templates available for download. It absolutely boggles the mind that this woman would be officially Certified by Adobe. And according to her bio on the product page, she is also a ""Certified Internet Webmaster.""

It's the sections that you can click to play; the chapters are just ""folder names"" for organization purposes.

If you are a beginner, the best way to learn this program is to start from chapter 1, section 1 and proceed in order to the last chaper, because this video starts with the basics and progresses to more and more complex topics.

The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (""Fireworks"" for ""Firefox,"" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.

Since each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the ""Watch and work"" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.

I should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.

POSITIVE:
* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.
*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.
* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.
* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.
* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.
* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.
* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.
* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.
* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.

NOT SO POSITIVE:
* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.
* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.
* There is no ""search"" function or ""index."" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.
* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)
* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a ""personal index"" these bookmarks have their limits.

On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.

I say this because the material is covered more deeply than what a beginner in the field of digital photography might be comfortable with.  Also, it is assumed that the student has some knowledge of digital photographic concepts (white balance, exposure, RAW format, etc.).  These topics are discussed without much intro-type explanation for beginners.  For me this is a good thing, as I had a reasonably good background going in.

44,4,FALSE,"10 2, 2010",A1RPTVW5VEOSI,321700945,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},Michael J. Edelman,"I was lucky to find this offered in the Vine program as I'd just upgraded to Lightroom 3, and had been looking for a good text or other training material. It's pretty complete in its coverage of Lightroom basics, and differences from Lightroom 2; the only real issue I have is with the pacing. And that's not a real complaint about the product; it's more of a personal preference.

What you get in the package is a slim volume of 100 pages, about half of which discuss Lightroom and photography in general terms; the remaining 50 pages are divided between notes on setting preferences in Lightroom and tables of keystroke shortcuts. Given that the booklet is glued into the packaging, it's not exactly a handy references. The bulk of the course, though, is on a disk that contains (as noted in the description) a full 10 hours of video lessons.

The lessons are divided up functionally in a manner that reflects Lightrooom's functional division- the first section is devoted to importing photos, followed by a section on the Library function. Each section is in turn divided into lessons covering one or two detailed areas. You can play all the sections and lessons in order, or pick and choose as you like. I began by playing straight through the first two sections (over two separate sessions) and picked up a lot of new and useful information about using Lightroom 3. Each lesson involves watching an expert carry out some function while narrating exactly what he's doing. The demonstrations and accompanying narration afre very clear, and made it easy for me to perform the same actions on my own. There's also a ""watch and work"" mode, in which you can shrink the video window down and try an example on your own in Lightroom, using supplied data files. Very nice.

What I particularly liked was the us of professional photographers, rather than trainers, to present the material. The result is a real-world approach, in which the instructor both demonstrates the full range of options for some piece (like importing) and then explains exactly how he uses this in his own workflow. What you get is not a theoretical exploration of how a piece of software could be used, but a real demonstration of how it's being used by someone working in the field. Of course, that can be a drawback, too; one particular photographer's idiosyncratic methods may not be best for you. But I think this program manages to avoid that, but presenting the full range of possible approaches before the instructor gives his personal preference.

The one problem I do have with the course is, I suppose, unavoidable in this sort of presentation, and that's that the videos are fixed in duration and what's covered. Going through everything is going to take you the full 10 hours, at a minimum. You may look ahead to one chapter for something you're specifically interested in, only to discover after watching it through that what you really need is in a different chapter. That's why I generally prefer a text and image based approach. For me, at least, reading is several times faster than listening. But as I say, that's just my personal preference. For many, if not most new users, this may be one of the best ways to learn enough yo get started managing workflow with LR3.",Good intro for new LR3 users,1285977600,3,
45,5,FALSE,"09 27, 2010",A1QWCRVV9VNLOK,321700945,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},Darwin&#039;s Bulldog,"I was extremely pleased with this training video. The video player was very full featured; far better than any I have used in other video training I have used. Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.)

It will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too.

The Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book.

The DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled ""The Photograper's Eye"" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good, although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in  Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD.

I have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with ""What's New in LR3"" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings.

If you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit. All you bookmarks are available from one of the tabs at the top... a really nice feature!

If you truly are a Lightroom beginner, this DVD will get you up-and-running quickly. If you have used Photoshop, and Camera Raw (CR) in particular, you will quickly see how adjustments in LR are so similar to CR, with LR adding so much more in terms of automation, asset management etc. Quirky start-up aside, this is an easy 5 star rating!",Excellent way to learn Lightroom,1285545600,,

I have Lightroom 2.7 so I was intrigued for two reasons: 1) what is new in Lightroom 3 that I should upgrade and 2) could I still learn something about the version that I have with this video. I am happy to say it exceeded my expectations.

The lessons are good; I actually look forward to learning more about Lightroom. The lessons are always focused on the computer screen - not wasted on watching the instructor speak. First I went through some of the lessons to get an overview of the features - some I found were explained in a way that made me realize that I should have been using them. But I will really use this as a reference when I want to work on my photos with the Watch and Work.

Watch and Work is a really cool feature. If you click Watch and Work (in the lower right corner) the application shrinks down and is placed in the upper left corner sort of out of the way. I say sort of because it is always on top and on my screen I am not able to get Lightroom completely visible. I can't find a minimize button so I have to go back to standard mode and then minimize it. But it does work and is a quick way to get the video up while I am working. (It's probably time I get another monitor...) The DVD does come with samples but I have no problem following along using my own photos.

While the lessons themselves are great I did find a few quirks.

When you first put in the disc Windows 7 pops up suggesting to run Start.exe. Choosing that starts the video with an intro from the two authors but there is no mention how to use the program. Fortunately there is a Table of Content in the upper left corner which is how I actually go through this. It isn't terribly difficult to use the video but it would make for a smoother and less timely start if they went over the use of it. The booklet does explain a little but not completely which goes for the help screen as well.

There is no install for the DVD. DVDs are either watched once or used for installation. Since I will use this as a reference and it will be used over and over they should have included an install so that you will always have access to the video. You can copy the entire DVD to your hard drive and setup a shortcut but for a lot of users that isn't always easy to do.

Right away I found an annoying orange menu that pops up even if I slightly bump the mouse. All it has are options for Full Screen or an info sidebar. These options are also available in the lower right corner. At first I wasn't sure if it was part their screen shots or the application on my computer. I have not yet found any info that explains this or how to turn it off and I have no use for this menu - strictly annoying.

Another annoyance is when you close the application it goes through the list, or credits, of who put it together. Why? My experience as a developer is that no one cares who created it; if it's good people will use it. But we get to see them every single time.
Tip: although it is an added step after you click the close button, click again and you won't have to wait through the credits.

The package comes with a booklet but it doesn't offer much. Half of it explains photography and how to take certain shots. If you are using Lightroom chances are you probably have several photography books already. Another section briefly goes through each of the new features in 3. And there is a section that shows the specific settings for certain screens and another section on the shortcuts. The booklet is not an alternative to learning the application but may be a handy reference for some.

The begin where you left off doesn't work for me in fact it suggested something I used yesterday.

But I really do look forward to learning Lightroom with this video. It is far better than the free ones I have found online. And it even helps me with 2.7. Once installed on my hard drive it works great as a quick reference. I am still debating on upgrading Lightroom at least right away. But this video made several features really clear that I otherwise might not have used. And while it does have a hefty price tag my benefits are worth the expense.",I look forward to learning Lightroom with this,1285545600,,
47,5,FALSE,"09 13, 2010",A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6,321700945,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},Conrad J. Obregon,"Some people learn more by watching than by reading. I know that I first learned about how to use Lightroom in videos by the redoubtable Michael Reichmann and Jeff Schewe, but that was mostly because they were the first out with instructional material. Mostly those videos were images of talking heads with an occasional screen shot. ""Learn Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 by Video"" is an offering by two other great image processing authors, Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland.

The approach taken is fairly standard. After an introduction the videos go chapter by chapter through each of the Lightroom modules, and an examination of most of the buttons and sliders that, because of its easy interface, has made Lightroom popular with so many photographers.  Each section shows a screen shot where the viewer can follow the moves made by the authors to apply Lightroom functions, accompanied by the voice-over of one of the two authors. The chapters cover everything from bringing images into Lightroom to outputting them to web sites or slideshows. The level of instruction is fairly simple, but if you've never used the software, the instruction will get the average person processing pictures after several hours of watching. More experienced users won't learn anything new, but they are not the audience. Not every function is covered in all aspects, like my favorite test, whether the discussion of keywords covers the importation of a keyword list from another source into Lightroom. On the other hand, although this isn't covered, it clearly a subject for a more advanced user.

At the end of each chapter there is an examination. Unfortunately, if you get an answer wrong, you won't be told the correct answer, so you'll have to watch the lesson again. Maybe that's not unfortunate.

The video comes with a booklet where Aaland first presents some ideas about composition (perhaps added because the video, like most Lightroom books, doesn't tell you when a slider or button is appropriate; for that, I'd recommend ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vision-Voice-Refining-Your-Vision-in-Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321670094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vision & Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (Voices That Matter)</a>"" by David duChemin). That's followed by a chapter about what's new in Lightroom 3. The disk also contains images that can be imported into Lightroom by the viewer to follow the same procedures as the authors in the lessons. I'd like to say that this allows one to follow along with the authors, but it was here that video presentation encountered a stumbling block. With a book you could keep the book in front of the computer and, if images were provided, the reader could follow along. To duplicate the experience there is a button in the lower right hand corner of the video screen, called ""Watch-and-Work"". If you click this, the video is reduced to about one-fourth of the screen. Unfortunately, when I tried to follow along with the video, the video image was often in the way and had to be moved around to gain access to the Lightroom sliders. Eventually I figured out that it was easier to pause the video and minimize the video screen and work in Lightroom. This doesn't take a computer guru to figure out, but given that the videos are aimed at tyros, it might have been useful to provide more detailed instructions in how to use the videos. Unfortunately there is just a very brief help screen, that, to make matters worse, refers to processing the picture in Dreamweaver! It might also have been useful to suggest to users that as soon as possible, they should import the images provided on the disk into Lightroom, as well as other instructions on how to best use the videos to learn.

I'm still a person who prefers books, being a geezer who didn't grow up with YouTube. I underline important ideas or read them twice, and even read them on a bus, without opening a laptop. To be fair, the video does allow for bookmarking (again undocumented), that accomplishes many of these functions and perhaps reading on the bus may not be the best way to learn about running a piece of software like Lightroom.

Easy to use, well-designed, and useful.

BUT... at a fairly basic ""this is Lightroom"" level.  So, if you're new to Lightroom, and a visual learner (as opposed to wanting to read everything in a book), this is an awesome resource.  It's kind of like having an experienced photographer friend sit down with you and a copy of LR3 for 10 hours and go over every feature, in a reasonable degree of depth, one feature at a time.  But you get to pause, rewind, and rewatch it whenever you want, add bookmarks to favorite parts you want to review later, etc.

You can also learn LR3 on your own; that's what I did.  I'd been using the program for over a year before getting this, so I didn't think I had much to learn.  While I wasn't sure how useful this would be, I was pleasantly surprised.  I use primarily the Library and Develop modules (all the time), and was hoping to learn more about the other three (Print, Web, and Slideshow).  I certainly did, and am comfortable with those now.  But I also learned some pretty useful things about the ones I use constantly (I haven't really used collections before, for instance, and that's going to be a huge time-saver).

The two photographers that guide you through lightroom introduce you to all of its features, but don't necessarily give too much creative input... they teach you what you CAN do, not what TO do.  For most people, this is fine.  But they're not there to refine and hone your creativity.  Just get you familiar with the program, which they do very well.

Instead, it has three main sections:  The first, is basically a ""welcome to photography, here's what you need to know to capture nice images"" with basic photographic advice.  Part 2 is ""what's new in LR3"" (compared to previous versions; only newly added stuff is mentioned).

I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.

There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.

The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the ""Classroom in a Book"" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.

One thing I got here more clearly than in the ""Classroom in a Book"" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an ""object based"" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).

Overall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on ""Best Practices"" serves as a useful complement to the ""how to"" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the ""Next Video"" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the ""Next Video"" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. ""Hawaiin"" instead of ""Hawaiian""), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the ""inverseKinematics_start.fla"" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.","A helpful introduction to Flash CS5 - a bit dry, perhaps, but very clear and useful explanations and great on ""best practices""",1290816000,,

It appears that the tutorial is built on Adobe Air, which make Javascript look positively robust and blazing. The interface is slow and quite unresponsive on a fast Mac. It's very frustrating that it is not aware of dual monitor setups either. There is an option to watch it full screen, but if you try to place the video tutorial on a second monitor -- which would be customary if the program you are trying to learn was on your main monitor -- clicking on ""full-screen"" jumps the tutorial to your main display and makes it full-screen there, covering up the Flash program!

The content and organization is pretty well done for beginner to intermediate level Flash programmers, but the numerous typos give it an  amateur whiff. How can there be typos in a video you ask? Well, the Video Training INSISTS on turning closed captioning on by default. No matter how many times you turn it off, when you relaunch the training, it appears again.

The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.

As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

All in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book. Know what to expect; you'll learn the basics, but you'll need to carry on the learning process yourself, by seeking out more advanced information or learning materials.","A good introduction to Flash, with some UI weaknesses",1287619200,,

It contains a DVD and a hundred page book supplement.  The DVD provides well-done video tutorials that you can follow along in watch-and-work mode using the starter work files included in the DVD, and the book provides useful reference materials (e.g., colored screenshots of user interfaces and how to use the various tool components, keyboard short cuts for specific tasks, etc.)

The video lessons cover all the important basics: how to create work projects and organize your files; how to use various tools and features; what are objects, shapes, symbols, movie clips, timelines, layers, frames, stage, etc; how to work with text and graphics; how to create animations such as objects moving in a choreographed fashion (motion tweens), or shapes morphing into other shapes (shape tweens); how to include ActionScript code snippets for more dynamic (but still simple) handling of events; how to build not just good-looking designs and presentations but also simple applications that react to text inputs, button presses, and mouse clicks; and how to test and deploy your work. By the time you're done with the lessons, you'll have an appreciation of how powerful Flash CS5 is and how learning even just the few techniques introduced in this video guide already empowers you to do interesting stuff!

The user interface for the video tutorials is easy to use, and although the book supplement comes with instructions on how to use that interface and navigate through the tutorials, most people should be able to figure out how to use the interface without having read those instructions first.

The video lessons are organized into eight chapters, most of which end with test questions that give you additional opportunities to revisit what you have just learned.  For the most part, the test questions quiz your knowledge of what was covered not just in the video lessons but also related materials in the book supplement; given that the video lessons and the chapters in the book supplement do not track each other perfectly (for example, the video lessons introduce motion tweens before shape tweens, but the supplement reverses this order), if you focus on the video lessons only, you might occasionally be surprised at getting quizzed on something that appeared unfamiliar by virtue of the fact that you might have missed reading some relevant materials presented (probably out of order) in the supplement.

Finally, I thought that while some of the materials in the video lessons are somewhat repetitious, the instructors have nevertheless done a good job showcasing some of the most useful features of Flash. Many students will appreciate how when covering features newly available only in the latest CS5 version of Flash, the instructors clearly demonstrate how these new features improve upon the replaced ""classic"" features by illustrating how both sets of features work.","Covers all important basics but also demonstrates how new features improve upon ""classic"" or pre-CS5 features",1287187200,,

I could not get past just turning it on. Everything was so different. I got worried and figured that I needed help to learn this. I didn't want to spend some more money but if I didn't the software that I had already bought was going to be worthless to me.

I sure am glad that I chose to get this. In the first 30 seconds of the DVD I learned an easier way to add media (video, audio, pictures) than what I had learned in studying Adobe's website for an hour. After watching it all, it seems so simple now. The narrator does move very quickly through the functions and how to work them so the pause button on my DVD player got a real workout. With the DVD paused I was able to try out some of his tips on my computer while I watched it. This was so helpful!

I recommend this to anyone who is new to editing video. This really helped me understand how easy it is to work the software and also just how much the software will do. By the end of the DVD I had learned things that I didn't even know that it could do. Just remember that he goes quickly and if you want to try it out on the computer along with watching the DVD that you will have to become a pro at pausing the DVD player.

Now that I know how to work Premier Elements to its full potential, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese better watch out. I will soon be turning out better video than anyone in Hollywood!

HJ eases you into the Japanese language, beginning with the hiragana alphabet. It doesn't just show you the character, it demonstrates HOW to write it, with proper stroke order. Also, you can click on any Japanese characters, and it will pronounce them for you very clearly. There is even a quick demonstration on how to pronounce words properly as opposed to the ""foreign"" way.

There are many quizzes as you progress through the hiragana and katakana to help you remember. (Although I also made my own flash cards to assist me - that was enormously helpful.) You will also learn Japanese vocabulary and grammar in an easy-to-understand way.

It is now June of 2008 and I can confidently write all of the kana, as well as write and properly pronounce many sentences. It's inspired me to try to find Japanese pen pals, and makes me want to visit Japan as soon as I can!

It was a simple program that, while not very attractive to look at, presented Japanese in a simple way that anyone could really understand. When I heard that there was a Human Japanese 2.0, I rushed to get the demo and eventually the full version.

Well, first let me talk about Human Japanese in general. As the name implies, the program tries to teach you Japanese in a ""Human"" way. Without fancy terminology or complicated explanations, but rather doing it in a way that a tutor might teach you. Giving you little hints to remember writing, or making silly acronyms to remember concepts, this program tries to do things like that. It certainly is refreshing to see that kind of teaching being used in a computer program.

Human Japanese 2.0 is broken up into 40 lessons, some focused on grammar while others try to steer the reader towards learning new words and expressions along with writing. At the end of each lesson, there is usually a quiz to test your knowledge of the things learned in that chapter. These can range from small multiple choice quizzes, matching games, and an ""Endless"" type quiz which tests your vocab.

Stuck in between every seven or so lessons are chapters devoted entirely to culture. These small 4-7 page bits are a treat to read. They talk about things like Geography, Prices in Japan, and Bathing among other things. Many more of these for Human Japanese 3.0 would certainly be nice.

The changes from Human Japanese 1 are certainly noticeable at first glance. The interface is changed from the plain white background of 1.0 to a nice background with shades of green and silhouettes of trees. There is now a small search bar on the right side of the screen to look up any vocab term that has appeared in the program. There are also visual aids added to the lessons which, while probably not amazingly helpful, do look nice.

Unfortunately, the changes from Human Japanese 1 are mainly visual. Although there are now 40 lessons, they are mostly just each of the 20 lessons from the previous version split into two lessons. This means that most of the 40 lessons are identical to content in the last version, although they tend to have a bit more meat on them (They are a bit longer, and most have a few extra vocab added).

The interface change is nice, but when making Human Japanese 3.0, I'd urge them to take the time to make up more lessons to further the readers knowledge.",Better than the Human Japanese 1...but not much changed.,1207612800,99,

- Introduces Hiragana and Katakana characters by teaching stroke order and pronunciation. The characters are introduced little by little with the help of a quiz, making them much easier to memorize as opposed to learning them all at once.
- Helpful cultural notes are dispersed throughout the software
- Concepts are introduced in an easy to understand, conversational way
- Audio recordings for all Japanese words and phrases

Cons
- Too much vocabulary is introduced at one time
- The vocabulary and concept quizzes are awful. There is no way to choose how many or which words are used in the quiz, it just quizzes you on everything in the chapter at random and indefinitely, making the quiz practically useless for chapters that have a lot of vocabulary, like chapter 28, which has 39 pages.
- There are no exercises whatsoever, only readings that do not require any user input. Because of this, in my opinion, coupled with the horrible quizzes, retention is rendered almost impossible.
- Some concepts are introduced seemingly at random. For example, the particle ""ni"" is introduced in chapter 20, but the particle ""de"" isn't introduced until chapter 35... The problem with this is that both particles are very similar in meaning and it would make a lot more sense to explain both of them at the same time. The result for me was that, for a long time, I incorrectly used ""ni"" in places where ""de"" belonged.
- Verb conjugation isn't explained at all. This to me is the worst part of the software. When the author introduces verbs, he introduces them in their ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms instead of their dictionary forms. This makes it impossible to know what is actually happening to the verb. For example, when he introduces the verb ""iku"" (to go), he introduces it as ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"", providing no explanation for how ""ikimasu"" conjugates to ""itte"". In fact, the only way to know how this happens is to know that the dictionary form of ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"" is ""iku"", but he doesn't even mention it! There is also no mention of the difference between ""u"" verbs, ""ru"" verbs, and irregular verbs, leaving the user with the impression that the ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms must simply be committed to memory.
- There are several typos throughout the software, including a typo in one of the Japanese examples.

Other thoughts:
I bought this software as a result of not being able to take the first two intro Japanese classes at my college. I figured that if I used this software, I could opt into the third course and continue from there. My reason for choosing Human Japanese was that I thought it would be much less overwhelming compared to using a textbook. Fortunately, it was. However, if I could go back in time I would definitely choose to use the Genki textbook instead. I was able to opt into the third class, but after going through the first Genki textbook and doing all the exercises, I can say confidently that the Genki textbook isn't that difficult to navigate and far more rewarding and informative.",Go with Genki instead,1403222400,9,

With this program, I am able to achieve my wish! This software is so down to earth and friendly, I am surprised I am not talking to an actual person.

I have had this software for a few months now, and when I get a break from my classes, I enjoy the time I spend learning this new language. There is one or two words placed wrongly in a sentence in English, but that is throughout the entire program, while its nothing to ponder on what they just said. You can also report it to Brak, and I am sure they will fix it.

How it works: At the beginning, there is a very mild and friendly introduction, that warms you up to what is coming later. Then, it gives you a tad but of history and few moments to tell you about the writing sysytem. Once that is over, it brings you through Hirigana, the first part, all the while showing you how to write the character and giving you a hint on how to write and how to remember it. Hirigana part 1 is over, now a few pages on the Geography of Japan. Now to Hirigana part 2! Once you have learned Hirigana, they launch you into an amazingly simple and easy introduction to Greetings and what to call things around the home, and explaining how verbs are used. There are 40 chapters, and I am only on 20, which is great, because I am at my own limit, as well as you can, either if you are slow or busy, or fast or in a rush. You need time for this though.

This software is cheap, as in the price, compared to Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone just starts flinging out words at you, where you have to figure out how to say it, and what it means, with no training under your belt. Not Human Japanese. I was about to buy a few books on how to speak and read Japanese, but i decided to go on a whim and purchase this software. I do not regret it, and it might have been the best 30 dollars i have ever spent......but i don't keep track. I am definitely going to buy Human Japanese Intermediate once I am done with this one. I am even hoping for them to do a Russian learning software.

Buy this if you are wanting a friendly, self paced software that you can have fun working through, but if you wished to be pushed through learning a language, and like to guess what your saying, go somewhere else. If this was 50 or 100 dollars, i would still buy it, and still say it is the best learning program i have ever used.

This program slowly introduces to the concepts of the language and then gives you a chance to read japanese characters. The japanese characters are click-able so you can listen to them. The author also demonstrates on how foreigners make a mistake on pronouncing words and he shows you how himself (He has an awesome voice).

I'm someone who has never done well with languages in a classroom setting. For some reason, my brain doesn't seem to jive well with the way most foreign language teachers teach. Nothing sinks in, concepts don't 'click', and  after I somehow pass the class, I forget everything.

That's what nearly happened when I took Japanese 100 in college last semester. The class would simply whizz by while I can honestly say I learned next to nothing. Finally, the week of finals, I decided I needed to do something to get up to speed so I'd pass. I used Human Japanese for a few days and learned more than I did during the whole semester. Not only that, but the program helped me to realize just how simple some of the concepts were.

While textbooks tend to describe things in technical-speak that would confuse my understanding even of my native language, Human Japanese does what the name suggests and what the developer promises: it explains Japanese in a personal, human way that does wonders for teaching the new language to someone. I can't tell you how many times I finished learning a new concept and was surprised at just how simple it had been. This program inspires confidence in your ability to learn Japanese. It doesn't take off and leave you in the dust anywhere, ever.

We use Rosetta Stone at school, and I literally hate the program. Never mind its price, Human Japanese is a far superior program for learning the basics of Japanese. The fact that it's much, much more affordable is a huge bonus. Keep in mind, Human Japanese has just released a follow-up program called Human Japanese Intermediate for people who have finished the original and want to delve further into the language.

First, I'll start you off with a little history lesson so that you know where I'm coming from in relation to language. I'm one of those people, one of those thousands of people who simply didn't get language. A second language wouldn't STICK in my brain. As soon as I began to grasp a concept, it would slip. As many Americans do, I was forced (more or less) to take a second language to pass high school. I chose spanish, as it is a money making language in the US. All throughout my spanish career, I struggled. In no offense, I didn't like the language. I didn't care about the culture, I didn't care about anything at all in relation to Spanish except for passing the class. Well, needless to say, while I passed the class, I didn't learn a damn thing. I didn't know why, and assumed it was because I was just one of those thousands of people who just didn't get language. But I do understand language now. It's taken me to my third year of college and a linguistics class to understand WHY I never really learned spanish--and the answer is so simple I could slap myself. It was because I didn't CARE about it! True, you can ""learn"" something that you don't care about--but do you excel? How long does it stick in your brain? Do you remember it or do you actually LEARN it? Ask yourself this!! I realized that I don't give a rats hat about spanish, and that subconsciously affected my learning. But I desperately wanted to become bilingual, so I took a look at a culture and language that I DO care about...

**(This is what you want to read!)
The Human Japanese program is outstanding, amazing, enthralling, captivating, and any other positive ""-ing"" word you can think of. YES, MAC USERS, WE CAN GET IT. Just not here, search it in the Ap store, and you will find it for around 20 bucks (18.99 if my memory hasn't failed yet). Just as the other comments say, it is indeed HUMAN like. He is so warm, simple, and even kind of funny! He cracks a few jokes here and there, and relates tough or questionable subjects to things English speakers can understand. He even gives history lessons so that we can better understand the ""whys"" and the ""hows."" There are animations, a real Japanese woman helping with pronunciation, everything! I absolutely love the program. I admit, I've just start using it--but at the same time, I'm halfway through learning Higarana. And, these things STICK. I don't know how he does it, but he puts his information in a way that really does stay with you. I remember things from pages (the program reads like a warm, friendly book) ages ago. In spanish class, I couldn't remember things we've talked about SENTENCES ago. Best 20 bucks spent.

Now, if you WANT to learn another language, you LIKE Japan and are INTERESTED in the language, with no experience, Human Japanese is the program for you. You have to want to learn it, but when you do, Human Japanese is here to hold your hand. Buy it! I pray that he makes an intermediate and advanced levels, because I don't want to learn from anyone or anything else. :)

Using Human Japanese it almost feels like I have a real teacher in front of me teaching. Plus it's a lot more fun than reading a book, since there are activities to help the information stick to your brain. It's not just a bunch of memorizing words, in Human Japanese you are actually taught how and when to use the words. Every Japanese word in the book is clickable and will pronounce it for you. Hearing it really helps. I like how the program breaks it up too, you go from learning vocab, to some culture information, to some new Hiragana/Katakana/etc. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting, and helps a lot because you are slowly introduced into each topic, rather than thrown in and expected to memorize everything. Definitely a great program! Though you can get the digital download for a bit cheaper (I think I paid $19 on the Human Japanese website) if you don't care about having the hard copy of the disc.

I just recently started back with my Japanese studies and started this software over. The software reads more like a book (a good book) and even covering the chapters I had already done before was entertaining. When I first started learning last year I struggled with the kana and was using boring hiragana and katakana workbooks. After switching to Human Japanese I breezed through learning the syllabaries and before I knew it, I was reading Japanese without the aid of romaji. The software slowly introduces hiragana, then katakana, then weens you off of the romaji. I hardly noticed this process happening, so it was the perfect pace for me!

English grammar was never a strong-point of mine. But this software does a great job of explaining the grammar and how it relates to English grammar and breaks it down so that it is easy to understand.

Let me begin by saying that I have been studying Japanese already for six years on my own. So, being already learned from books and other software programs I was a bit hesitant to try another one and have to sit through the motions of basic Japanese BUT the way that they organize this software, it kind of lets you skip around so you're not sitting for hours through these boring automated lessons feverishly clicking the stuff you already know just so you can move on. Human Japanese is pretty open to the user so you can approach Japanese from whatever angle you want. I spent the first week with this software hitting the chapters I wanted to touch up on and found that their way of teaching is actually really comforting just like other reviewers have said.

So much in fact that I am now just going back over the stuff I 'already knew' and am constantly getting pleasantly surprised by the way that they explain those things. Like it makes even MORE sense now.

The writing style is calm with some mild jovial points that catch your attention, really it IS as if you are sitting there with a Japanese person and an American person, both fluent in the language and they are EXPLAINING it to you, point for point, making connections with English that really - I haven't even seen referenced in many books I own and I'm up to about 35.

Overall, this is a great product for learning the basics of Japanese to an extent that allows basic communication, especially speech. The integrated audio files demonstrating pronunciation are a life saver and help demonstrate proper pitch accent to keep your own speech clear and comprehensible.

There's a lot of good vocabulary and grammar, and at the end of each chapter there are quizzes to help you judge how well you retained the material and also to practice. My only complaint is that the quizzes are often very large, making it difficult to learn smaller groups of vocabulary at a time, and that you are not able to generate custom, cumulative quizzes to test your knowledge overall.

Something I thought was lacking was the writing aspects. While the introduction to Hiragana is great, the material on Katakana is more stretched out, and many foreign words are first written in Hiragana because of your lack of knowledge in a certain chapter. Additionally, the Hiragana chapter has additional memory exercises, whereas the Katakana is limited to a matching game which isn't a particularly good way to memorize them. For this reason, I still haven't.

And finally, in my introductory college textbook, even a few kanji are introduced per chapter as the book goes on. I'm not saying this product should have hundreds of kanji to teach, but I feel introducing some of the more basic ones would have helped.

Now, I realize how stupid that urge was. Human Japanese has easy-to-understand lessons that never drag on and never rush. The cultural articles, which may sound boring now, are actually quite interesting and make me want to learn even more. I also love the animations for the symbol drawing,and the quizzes and games that have familiar formats. You'll understand when you see them.

166,5,FALSE,"06 16, 2011",A3309IEQSU5WF9,615179088,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},Amani2,"This is one of the best tools for complete beginners to Japanese. Human Japanese will teach you how to write the kana, why the Japanese writing system is the way it is, as well as basic grammar and about 1800 words/sentences (with good quality audio recorded by native speakers). Everything is explained clearly in plain English and I found it fun to use. I only have a few minor complaints:

-Human Japanese does not mention pitch/word accent. While Japanese does not have a ""stressed"" accent like English does, syllables can be low or high in pitch (similar to how our voice rises when we ask a question in English). However, the pitch accent is very obvious in the recordings, so as long as you model your pronunciation after the audio, you'll know how to say the words properly.
-This software briefly mentions whispered vowels, but only for ""su"" and not other vowels. When vowels come between certain consonants, they are often whispered. Again, if you copy the audio's pronunciation you'll be fine.
-The search functionality included in the software is helpful, but it only searches for key words, not the entire text. It would be nice if it showed all instances of a word.
-Another complaint is that words and sentences must mainly be learned through memorization. They are presented in a list format that is clickable with audio. There are short quizzes and games available to practice, but it would be cool if they made this part of the learning more interactive and fun, especially since this is software. The advantage of the list format is that it gets right to the point, so if you just want to learn words quickly without going through a bunch of animations, you can. It's more like an interactive textbook with good explanations.
-Additionally, since Human Japanese is a beginner course, it only gives an introduction to kanji and doesn't cover all the grammar found in a regular textbook. Its purpose is to give you the confidence that you can study Japanese, even by yourself! For what it teaches, the price is right.

It's easy to be overwhelmed by Japanese as a beginner because it is completely backwards from English. Textbooks often assume that you already know how to write the kana and they don't explain the basics in much detail. It's a shame that most textbooks aren't suited for self-learning beginners, but that's where Human Japanese excels. After finishing this course, you'll have a very solid foundation and be able to jump into any popular Japanese textbook series.

If any of my friends ask me what they should use to start learning Japanese, I'm definitely going to recommend this. It's suitable and friendly for just about anyone with an electronic device. I don't think I can say that about the majority of language materials I own. I really hope this company makes more advanced levels, as well as versions for other languages. I'm also trying to learn some Chinese right now and a Human Chinese would be wonderful!

Instead of reading reviews, just go to the Human Japanese website and try it out for yourself. There is a demo available for your browser as well as a downloadable version for Windows. It goes through 8-12 chapters depending on the demo, and there are 40 chapters total, so you should be able to get a good feel for the full version. Human Japanese is also available for the Mac on the Mac App Store, as well as the iPhone, Android, and Windows 7 phones. For the phones there is also a free ""Lite"" version, which I downloaded prior to writing this review. The phone versions seem to be the same as the PC/Mac ones. I haven't used the phone app much, but it lists the same 40 lessons and the first few chapters have the same exact text and audio. It's obviously a bit easier to read the text on my computer screen than on my phone, but the formatting looks fine.

If you want to learn through software and you've thought about trying Rosetta Stone, get this instead. It's much better ""bang for your buck"" than Rosetta Stone and you'll have a more thorough understanding of how the Japanese language works. It doesn't cover as much vocabulary as Rosetta Stone or use pictures, but there are so many other cheaper (and more efficient) methods to build vocabulary, such as Anki, a free flashcard software, with user-shared flashcard decks (some even include pictures and audio).

Overall, 9/10.

If you are looking for an audio program, too, I really like Michel Thomas' Beginners Japanese course. Similar to Human Japanese, it will give you a nice start to speaking and basic grammar. I think it would complement this software well.

167,5,FALSE,"05 12, 2011",A3IXP5VS847GE5,615179088,{'Format:': ' CD-ROM'},Dragonflies &amp; Autumn Leaves,"My situation: Both my 8 y.o. son and I are learning Japanese together.  I have taken one year of Japanese in college, my husband speaks some, and we have access to native speakers.  That said, mostly I am a beginner needing a simple, clear, and accurate text that we can use for self-study.

We are using the i-pod touch application of Human Japanese (which is very handy to carry around in your pocket and use to practice pronunciation and what-not where ever you happen to be.)

Reasons this software stands out:

  -I LOVE that I can instantly hear the pronunciation of any Japanese words or sentences simply by touching them.  Japanese writing is introduced immediately, so this is very helpful in building your reading skills and  pronunciation at the same time, which is the only effective way to do it.  This is a HUGE improvement over my college text books, where one has to pop in separate audio C.D.'s to hear the lesson's vocabulary.  With Human Japanese you see it and hear it together all at the same time, and it's easy to access.

  -I love that the hiragana and katakana are animated, so you can see how it is drawn simply by touching it.

  - The explanations and layout are easy and enjoyable to read.  My son enjoys reading the lessons to me in the car, and is not intimidated or confused by it.
It's clear this is someone who knows from experience what would be useful to an English speaker learning Japanese (and is no doubt creating the text he WISHED he had when learning.)

My son and I have been taking a very leisurely pace and are on chapter 10 after about 5 months.  This is mostly due to wanting to get the kana down solidly, and having the limitations of an 8 y.o. attention span.  We aren't doing tons of talking yet, but the delay is worth having a comfortable reading relationship with the kana.  I have skimmed ahead and the other chapters seem well done.

I do find it helpful to do some supplementing:

 We could not remember all the hiragana and katakana characters so easily, so we made our own charts, and would quiz ourselves by drawing the characters in the air, until we could do them from memory.  I highly suggest printing out two blank 10 by 5 box grids (plus one drawn in for ""n"") and making a hiragana and katakana chart for yourself.  You can easily print out a chart from the web for reference, but making your own really helps the memory.  We have used practice print outs from a Japanese website for kids, that are fabulous, with cute pictures for the characters that teach you simple words at the same time.  They have corresponding Hiragana and Katakana charts.  The site is kids dot nifty dot com fowardslash study forwardslash index dot htm
The chart with the yellow background is the hiragana, the mint-green is the katakana, and the pictures with the pink ice cream and candy are the worksheets.

This, however, is only to supplement: Human Japanese will teach you what need to know about the characters...this just gives extra practice to those who need to write it themselves, and see it all in a chart in one spot.

For the numbers chapter I found myself wanting to know what the Kanji for the numbers are, and looking that up on the web.  I wish it had been included in the lesson, even if we weren't technically covering Kanji yet.  Same thing for the days of the week.  I found helpful info. fairly easily online for this [...], and also a more useful way of understanding the number units ""man"" (10,000) and ""oku"" (100,000,000) by showing them grouped by 4 places instead of three (shift that comma over so you get 1,0000 and 1,0000,0000.)  This is a small thing, but very useful for understanding what is going on with the numbers, and I'm surprised it wasn't presented that way.

Despite me wanting to supplement here and there, this is a great program to use as the backbone of your beginning study.

I can't believe it's only $25 when programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur cost more than  $300. It's well thought-out, with interesting tidbits on how the Japanese language compares to English in terms of numbers of syllables, writing, how it evolved from its initial use of Chinese characters. Very interesting stuff. The tone is conversational, as if you were learning from a live teacher who also has a sense of humor. For example, here's an excerpt from chapter 3: Hiragana:

""If Japanese used only Hiragana and Katakana, it would be one of the simplest writing systems in the world. Alas, the picture is a bit more complicated than that. See, when Hiragana was invented, Chinese characters didn't just roll over and die. Keep in mind that Kanji were associated with wealth, power, and education. So for centuries, most of the people who had those things continued to write extensively in Kanji.""

It's hard to be bored with stuff like that.

I've tried using Pimsleur, but the repetitive, listening-only method doesn't work for me. After saying ""I understand/I don't understand"" 10 times in all its variations, I had to stop. And I was only in the middle of the first 20-or-so-minute less.

Human Japanese is different because it's engaging. You can click on words to hear the pronunciations, but you can see the romanized spelling of Japanese words and/or the kana and/or the kanji. This is what language-learning should entail--seeing, hearing, and speaking (which you do to yourself, of course). I only wish that Human Japanese had a recording function, like the ""Talk Now!"" series does, which allows you to record your pronunciation and play it back.

To me, this is simply the best place to start your Japanese learning. It gives you a solid foundation in the basics of Japanese writing, grammar, sentence structure, culture, and gets you over many of the hurdles that beginning Japanese learners face.

This product is an amazing deal, in my opinion. For such a low price, you learn so much, you enjoy learning it, and you actually remember what they teach. This software is like a favorite, enjoyable book that you just can't put down.

- A warm, inviting approach that makes it HUMAN and not like a textbook.
- The tech support is amazing. The creators are really nice, always trying to improve their software and bring it to new places and levels. They respond immediately.

What's in it for you?
- If you don't know hiragana and katakana, you'll learn how to write it, stroke order, stroke number, and little tips to remember how to write the kana well. If you're like me and already know it, it can give you a nice refresher course!
- Culture, history, geography, and more presented in a way that keeps you interested.
- Nice, clear photographs and clear male and female speaking voices.
- Dialogue that helps you learn to recognize speech patterns, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and learn to read hiragana and katakana at the rate they are speaking, instead of relying on romaji.
- Easy to navigate chapters and reviews. Reviews that include flash cards and the very helpful vocabulary quizzes.
- Compliments books and other learning methods well, and is a great, easy to use reference for anything you need a refresher on - like wa and ga, or what that darn word for kitchen is.

I have a good deal of language learning experience and I just felt like the teacher I had was making it way too complicated (although I think she was trying to make it easier in her defense).  It really isn't all that difficult of complex a language.  It's simply mysterious because of the writing system and grammar differences.

Here's my advice.  Take the hiragana and write down the first ten characters.  Repeat repeat repeat until you can do it from memory.  Then add ten more.  Repeat procedure.  You will have all of your hiragana and katakana down in no time.  Honestly, a couple of days would suffice if you really want to learn it quickly.  Once you have that down, you will feel like you have your feet on the ground and the rest will not be so scary.  If you would like to practice, you can google ""hiragana practice"" or something like that and find quite a few little quizzes or games, etc.  That's a good way to keep it current.

Anyway, Human Japanese is exactly that, human.  It's not going to treat you like a robot student and try to program you with information.  Expect to be told digestable amounts of information.  It will obviously be quite different than English, so just accept it and move on.  Things will start to come together before long and you will find there are some things you actually understand.  This is encouraging.  Now and then, bits and pieces of cultural knowledge will come up to break up the lessons and keep it from getting boring.  This is all done in a very friendly way, as if you were learning from a gentle tutor who just wants you to enjoy learning and eventually understand.  Honestly, this is how it should be.

Many competitive software products either spend too much time on memorizing phrases or random vocabulary, focus too much on pedantic grammar rules, or make little or no attempt to present the written word in Japanese.  Human Japanese is, in my opinion, the BEST in integrating the spoken with the written word.  You will learn plenty of grammar but it is presented in a user-friendly way. You will get lots of vocabulary, and you will be recognizing sentences in kana before you know it.  But importantly, once you have worked your way through the lessons you will find that your confidence is way up.

This is a shame because most of the activities work quite well.

However as a previous user mentioned - there are still af few glitches in there - thankfully not many.

What is more problematic is the English vs American accents.

Some of the differences are very frustrating for the kids, and leaves them stranded on the same level, unable to progress.

In the Fireman sounds game - the short vowels u and o sound almost identical.

For English speakers (UK, Australia, NZ, Sth Africa etc) these sounds are very different.
with the short 'u' sound clearly being pronounced 'uh' as in 'cup' or 'but'
and the short 'o' sound pronounced as 'o' as in 'cot' or 'orange'

However the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.
So instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.
However in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.

Similarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.
eg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min
chicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in
kitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin

Finally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.

Summary:
The Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.

The beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.

Apart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.

Probably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.

***
The games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it.

For better or worse, Ribbon interface is here to stay.  Is there something new that Microsoft can bring to the table?

I write as a sole proprietor who has been using Office 365 Enterprise for half a year.  I installed Office 2013 RTM (i.e. final version) about a month earlier than the official release in late January 2013.  My review will answer 1) why and who should upgrade to Office 2013 and 2) which version (Home & Business, Pro, Office 365 Home Premium, Small Business or Enterprise) to choose.

For Q1 (who should and why upgrade), my short answer is: upgrade if you are: a) using a touch computer; b) you own several computers and use all of them to edit the same documents; c) you are running on a slow computer and wants some extra speed.  Otherwise there is no need to upgrade from 2007/2010.  2003 users will have to decide whether they want to make the switch to Ribbon.

1A - Using a touch computer
I own a Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, a Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Office 2013 automatically recognizes the touchscreen and increases the spacing between icons for me.  Frankly the increased spacing is not much use on my 11.6 inch display as mis-clicks are still frequent.  I still resort to the built-in pen for clicking the small icons (Save, undo etc).

More importantly, the new version supports gestures such as pinch to zoom and flicking the screen to scroll.  This, together with Windows 8 Pro, make touch experience almost bearable on a PC.

Of course, to truly take advantage of Office 2013's touch function, you also need Windows 8.  The on-screen keyboard in Windows 8 is simply better than the one in Windows 7.  The most important improvement is the maximize icon next to the X button of the keyboard.  Press it, and the keyboard becomes ""one with the taskbar"".  The app will not occupy the space beneath the keyboard and make itself inaccessible (because the keyboard floats above it).

Word now supports a Reader mode, which is HUGELY useful and makes me want to convert all my ePub to word documents.  The idea is simple: Word reflows the text to single column/double columns while maintaining certain formatting like italic, fonts, highlighting etc and discarding others (tabs, line spacing for example).  This is similar to what we experience from other eReaders (Amazon Kindle, ePub readers etc).  The great thing about reading document in Word 2013 is that you can save your annotation directly on the file - there is no need to worry about syncing annotation.  Contrast this to reading ePub - each software saves its own annotation file that cannot be easily read by another software.

1B - Multiple computers, one document
Having multiple computers is both a blessing and a curse.  Nothing beats turning off your office computer and take an early leave, knowing that whatever you failed to complete can be finished at home.  However it is a nightmare to learn that the document (or the newest version of it) is not available when you arrive at home.

There are many ways to transfer files from office to home, from the tedious (USB, manual or software assisted) to the care-free (dropbox automatic sync).  Your organization may or may not allow USB drives (for good reasons).  Dropbox requires administrative privilege which 99% of the working force do not have.  With Office 2013 you have a third option - save to your own Skydrive.  If you purchase the non-subscription version, you get 7GB space of Skydrive, Office 365 Home Premium gives you 27GB.  For the business version, storage depends on the base subscription and add-on plans.  Skydrive is like a USB stick that connects to your computer through the Internet.  You can create folders, save files, read files, delete files just as you would on a USB stick.  The difference is that it is always available as long as you have connection to the Internet.

To save to Skydrive, you must first have a Microsoft Live account.  If you have a Hotmail/outlook.com email account, you already have one.  You can also register a Live Account with any email you own (gmail Yahoo university mail).  You then login to this Live account from within Office, you only need to do it once for each computer, and you can do it in Excel/Word/etc.  After you have logged in, you can Save the document to Skydrive by pressing the icon linking to your skydrive, and you will be prompted with your Skydrive's folder structure - just as what you would see if you were to save on C drive.  To open a file, choose Open, then press the icon to your skydrive, and viola - your file is there.  A little icon called Office Upload Assistant on bottom right area next to the clock (the notification area) tells you whether all documents have been uploaded.

I also like the fact that opening Word 2013 shows you a Welcome screen with built-in templates AND YOUR OWN TEMPLATES (provided they are saved in Skydrive/locally).  No longer do you need to go through layers of folders before finding the template for Invoice etc.  You can also ""pin"" your favorite templates so that they are one-click away from being created.  You can of course still create new documents from templates the way you would in 2007/2010.

1C - Performance
Performance is BIG thing nowadays.  Finally Microsoft saw the need to reduce the footprints of its software and make them more suitable for the ""average"" machines.  It used to be the case that business machines are evaluated by how many Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can be opened simultaneously while running on Windows Vista!

Having used the RAM-eating Office 2007 and the atrociously slow Office 2010, Office 2013 breathes new life to my 4 years old Dell Latitude E4200 (running on an ultra-low voltage dual-core Penryn processor).  I used to uncheck Outlook when I re-installed Office 2007/2010 because they start up painfully slowly.  The speed of Outlook 2013 is almost tolerable (about 7 seconds).  Outlook 2013 also does not cause my notebook to stutter.

The re-sizing on Word has also been improved.  It no longer draws accurate snapshots of the document as you zoom.  Instead it ""blurs"" the document as you zoom, and after you have settled on the zoom level, it draws a final, accurate snapshot.  It may not seem much, but coming from a computer-engineering background, I suspect this reduces CPU workload (and thus energy use) significantly.

Saving, opening, and switching between Ribbon tabs now feel instant even on my crappy 4 years-old laptop.  On my new Samsung tablet (sporting the newest Intel processor), starting Word is instant and outlook takes a mere 2 seconds to show.  The whole experience is very much like using an iPad, where every app loads instantaneously.

New features
I can only comment on Word, Onenote and Outlook 2013, which I use daily.  I will let my more knowledgeable fellow reviewers comment on the rest.

Word 2013
New features include the reader mode, touch-icons, touch gestures (mentioned above).

Track Changes is now infinitely more useful as it shows comments like a conversation.  The new Office Store allows you to install third-party apps (such as Merriam-Webster Dictionaries) to increase functionality.  You no longer need to ""hunt"" for plug-ins as you would for all previous versions.

You may or may not need the add pictures from an online location function.  The ability to embed YouTube video is also of dubious use - I prefer saving the youtube video offline, convert it and send it as an attachment to the word document.  This way my client won't ring me at 2am complaining they cannot view the clip (whether it is due to their connection to YouTube or some technical problem I do not care to solve), but this is just me.

The much-touted PDF manipulation is trash.  It seems that whatever PDF file I open using Word 2013, formatting is heavily messed up.  Apparently Microsoft tries to convert PDF to DOCX first before you can do any meaningful operation.  You are better off with a software that treats PDF as a PDF, such as the cheap but excellent PDF-XCHANGE software suites.

OneNote 2013
I could not be bothered to compare the feature sets between OneNote MX (free with Windows 8) and OneNote 2013.  It suffices to note that MX has fewer features but a more touch-centric control.
OneNote still does not get the degree of formatting control like Word.  You cannot make multi-layered lists or format text (and change formatting) using an umbrella category (like the Body, Heading 1, Heading 2).  Still, I enjoy jotting notes with OneNote much more than with Word.  Lists just indent to the proper place EVERY SINGLE TIME and there is no need to deal with page breaks.

I cannot think of any new features that are worth mentioning.  Onenote 2010 already had some sort of integration with the predecessor to Skydrive (called Live Drive).  The auto-correct still does not correct Recognise to Recognize etc (as Word 2013) does.  You can still add Online picture as you do in Word 2013.  There is also a new helper software that sits on the Taskbar and help you get screen capture quicker.  I always turn off the helper software because it adds unnecessary complexity to my taskbar.

Outlook 2013
Microsoft has not gone enough to change Outlook 2013.  Just as 2007/2010, it is extremely difficult to change account settings such as whether to download headers only or full text (with or without attachments).  The data file (OST or PST) still reside in the elusive place of C:\User\(user name)\AppData instead of your own ""My Document"" folder.  Sure you will forget to back that up as you re-install windows?  You also cannot see all emails using an ""Unified Inbox"" as you would with a 2-year old android phone/iPhone without using a script (search unified inbox vba if you really want to know)

Outlook has always struggled to find a proper interface.  I still recall using Outlook 2000 and being greeted with a Today's screen which shows some of my unread emails and upcoming appointments in extremely small fonts.  Outlook 2013 is better, when you start it shows you the Inbox, and you can quickly switch to appointments/contacts from the bottom left huge icons.

One new feature is integration with Facebook/other social networks.  The idea is to merge your contacts with Facebook's contacts.  I only connected about 20% of my friends because Outlook doesn't know Charles Jeremy Moore in outlook is really Charles Moore on Facebook.  You can of course manually link them as you could in the People app in Windows 8, but I cannot be bothered.

Assuming you have linked facebook contacts with Outlook, you can see a snapshot of your friend's profile while reading his email.  Useful?  I doubt it.  It is not often the case that your business associates will write something you absolutely must know business-wise (gossiping is another matter).  If there is some blogs/feeds you must read, the recommended course is to setup an RSS feed and read it regularly.  Stumbling upon someone's relationship status only distracts you from the current work.

It may or may not be a new feature, but pinning Outlook 2013 to your taskbar allows you to create tasks/appointments quickly.  Right-click the icon (not left click) and you will be greeted with a short-cut for New Appointment/Email/Contact/Task/Meeting.  What is best is that using any of the above will not launch Outlook 2013, not the whole program at least.  It is extremely handy for adding new appointments etc when you are talking on phone.  The ability to quickly add appointment from Outlook 2013 is one of the reasons I ditched Google in favour of my Office 365 Exchange account for storing calendars and contacts.  (note: Outlook 2013 cannot sync with Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync as of now, Outlook blames Google for not having the newest Exchange version).
WARNING: do not use the New Email function from the right click menu.  After you have typed your email, it is stored at the Outbox but NOT send out.  You have to launch Outlook to send it.  I cannot understand what Microsoft is thinking...

2 - Comparison
I have been using Office 365 to host my business email address and website for half a year, so I am familiar with the subscription model.

Feature-wise Office Pro and Office 365 is the same (but note the difference in Skydrive storage).  Simple math tells us that the price for Office Pro equates 4 years of Office 365.  The catch for purchasing Office Pro is that you are limited to 1 PC while Office 365 covers 5.  If you own more than 1 device, Office 365 is a no-brainer, or so it seems.

The reason why I gave Office Pro 5 stars while Office 365 Home Premium 3 stars is solely based on Price alone.  If you are a sole proprietor/small business, you are better-off with the Office 365 business plans (as I am subscribing).  If you are a Home User, as the name Home Premium suggest, I make the following assumptions: 1) your company pays for the office licence in your work computer(s) and 2) you do not have more than 1 home computer that needs Office.  Under this assumption the 5 PC advantage practically falls away.  The remaining question is whether you will upgrade in 4 years and whether the extra storage matters.

4 years is a bit longer than 1 product cycle (see 2003 - 2007-2010-2013).  If you will buy/subscribe Office 2016/2017 (if there is one) when it is released, then subscribing to Home Premium will present better value.  If you will skip one product cycle (i.e. skipping 2016/2017 and purchase 2020/2021), then Office Pro is better value.  I think most home users can afford to lag behind more than 1 product cycle.  New products are not always better, often the new features are useless to a home user and the new interface just spells frustration.

I think Office 365 HP is only appeal to users who match every criterion below:
1) You need Outlook/Access/Publisher
2) You have more than 1 computer
3) You plan to receive the next Office as it becomes available
4) You are not benefitted by Office 365 business versions

Regarding 1) above, most home users need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only, and their needs are well served by the cheaper Home versions.  Please note that if you do not use Outlook now, you probably won't need it in the future.  It is an overkill for checking gmail etc.  Access and Publisher require you to sit down and learn, possibly taking 1 month each before you fully appreciate their use and advantage over Excel/Word.  There is no point in going for Office Pro or Office HP just to get all software and be ""future-proof"" if Office Home Student/Home Business is good enough.

If you are willing to pay so much for the extra software (Outlook/Publisher/Access), but doesn't receive a free licence from your company, chances are that you work at a SMB.  SMBs stand to benefit A LOT from Office 365 business (see below), and even though you may not implement all the features, Office 365 business is still worth considering.

Office 365 Home Premium is expensive compared with Office 365 Enterprise.  At $20/Month Office 365 Enterprise gives you all Office software, your own exchange email account, Sharepoint and Lync (basic) servers.  The website shows Office Professional Plus 2010, but you can download Office 2013 RTM from TechNet and use your Office 365 login name to get the software running.  That was how I got Office 2013 a month earlier than the general public.

I wish only to add that regardless of whether you use Office 365 HP or Office 365 Ent, Office Web App is trash.  The idea of being able to edit document from a web-browser (running on an iPad maybe) is attractive, but unrealistic.  The reasons are: 1) Web App only supports DocX etc formats, but not the old formats; 2) more importantly, formatting is often MESSED UP when you use Web App.

More coming: the benefit of having your own exchange account and more importantly sharepoint server (in the coming week) and why it is much better value to sole proprietor/small business.","Touch interface, faster performance, business subscription may have better value",1359417600,235,

I knocked two stars off because, among other things, Outlook 2016 doesn't have a unified Inbox.  Each email address has it's own .pst.  So, if you have multiple email accounts, you'll either need to look through multiple inboxes for your mail, or write a rule to direct all your accounts into a new .pst you'll create.  I did this, but that's not without its problems, too.  Unbelievable.  I like POP email because it resides on my local machine, and can be easily searched.  It's obvious Microsoft, in this version, wants you to use IMAP, which does no more than show you a picture of what's already in your web based email accounts.  The argument is that IMAP allows you to check email from multiple devices, but with POP you can still leave email on the server by simply checking a box (Gmail, etc).  And, IMAP makes searching for a key word among all your emails impossible.  I like the 5 machine licenses, but would rather have Outlook 2007 than this.

It would not install, so I got remote ""help"" from Microsoft. The first tech screwed it up by editing multiple registries, and renaming folders.

I then discovered QuickBooks WOULD NO LONGER work thanks to Microsoft. I further discovered they changed my default browser, and left three new programs installed on my machine that I do not want. Further, 36 new ""important updates"" started appearing with windows updater. QuickBooks absolutely would not reinstall or repair from the product DVD. Thank heavens for Revo Uninstaller.

I downloaded Office 365 on a brand new computer from Dell. Went through all updates to Windows 10 to make sure I was at the latest and greatest release. Mapped network drives and verified I could access files on the NAS (Network Attached Server) I have on our home network. So far so good. This is when I installed Office 365; note that Office 2007 not yet installed on this machine. I have 3 other PCs, one of which is an old laptop (7 years) which this new pc is to replace. All of the others PCs are running Windows 10, Office 2007 and dta stored on the NAS working just fine.

Office 365 installs fine and I of course check for and install all Office updates. I am able to open files from the NAS but every time I do so I get the protected view warning that documents downloaded from the internet could be unsafe. Not wanting to have to click enable for that warning every time for the rest of my life for any file that I open from the NAS I went to make my NAS location a Trusted Location. But when I follow Microsoft's instructions on how to do that I get the ""cannot do this for security reasons error"". Sigh - Microsoft has now made it irritating and unnecessarily complex to use my home network. SO I look on the web and find this is not an uncommon problem but the homebrew solutions out there involve editing the registry or other equally arcane solutions involving trusting someone on the web's incantation to fix it - ""really it will, just trust me"".

Next step - call Microsoft Tech support. I'll bet you can guess how that turned out. I quickly exhaust the minuscule competence of the first level support, but to be fair all I really expected was for them to be able to send me to someone who had competence beyond check the power cord and on button.  So I get a scheduled time for Tier 2 to call me back . Fair enough. I get a call from Tier 2 asking me what is the issue. So all the work I spent explaining the issue to the first help person was wasted. This would prove to be a recurring theme since I would have to start all over with each new person. So this expert asked to take remote control of my machine. OK. Then they turned off protected view entirely, which meant I would be eliminating security for the entire internet. Not what I needed. So took the time to step her through the process of Trusted Locations and explained I just wanted to trust my NAS, not the entire hacking community. She was able to see the error message, but had no idea how to troubleshoot this. Fair enough - I expected that she would pass me on to the next tier and to a technician  who specialized in the area. But  instead she asked to take a few minutes to confer with her team. OK - I appreciate someone who wants to figure things out and is willing to consult with teammates. A little while later she comes back and wants to try everything but this time as an administrator. Good idea but doesn't work. Then here is the stunner - she asked if I could call an IT person. I thought she meant a Microsoft help IT person at first, but no she meant did I have an IT person somewhere in the home. I then patiently explained that I was the person who set up my PCs and Home network and that It all worked just fine on the other machines. She basically said I am out of luck then.  What?!?!  SO I stated I would need to get a refund. That of course prompted her to say she would transfer me over to the commercial side, could I please hold while she transferred me. Now we're getting somewhere! Nope!  I talked with the commercial side operator, explain yet again the issue and she asks for my domain email account. I do not have one. She says they cannot help a home user. She gives me another phone number. I call it and give them my case number again and explain the issue again only to find out I am back at the basic help desk again. But the help desk person says the even though this is an issue found in Office, it is likely a Windows function causing the problem. He sends me on to the Windows tech support. After waiting on hold for 37 minutes and 17 seconds I finally arrive at a human being, She asks me to please tell her what the issue is. Since I have had plenty of practice by now I can recite it quickly and subconsciously. She states that she would have to escalate the problem so would I please hold, but then we are disconnected and I never receive a call back. I call back to tech support, they say it was unacceptable that I should have to wait so long. I agreed. But they would have to escalate the issue to a higher tier and would it be okay if they called back in 30 minutes to an hour. After verifying they had the correct phone number I thanked him for his time and hung up. And that's the last I heard from Microsoft. Several hours wasted...

So then in about 30 minutes I was able to install Office 2007 on the new machine, check and install all the latest updates,  map the network drives, and verify the proper functioning without even having to set trusted locations - and - bonus - was able to request a refund from Amazon, have it approved, and UPS scheduled to pick up this defective product and send it back.

Kudos to Amazon for being professional to work with and quick to respond. I am so relieved I bought through Amazon instead of Microsoft.
Microsoft - you have a long, long way to go.

In (1), the recorded audio quality is terrible. This is not the same as the crisp audio quality I experienced back in Office 2013. And sadly, there is no solution to this problem unless you record your voice with a third party software and later sync the audio with the video.
In (2), the laser pointer is disabled despite tons of people requesting for this feature online. It's just not there, unless you record your video and later insert a pointer using some video editing software.

ORIGINAL POST
About the subscription: 5 Stars. You buy the keycard, enter the code in the right spot, and BOOM your Office 365 membership is extended by a year (if you're renewing). Plus, you save about $15 (for the personal version) over what Microsoft charges if you go through them. How do you pass up $15 off???

About Office 365:
First, 1TB of cloud storage for a year is a good value all on its own. Dropbox will set you back $99 for the same thing. Google Drive, $100. There are OneDrive apps for every mobile device, so you can take your files with you. For cloud storage alone, it's a no-brainer. So even if you HATE Microsoft Office, OneDrive is good.
Second, you get the latest version of Office (currently 2016 on PC). Oh, when Microsoft upgrades Office, you get the upgrade too. No extra costs. This isn't just a bunch of web apps you can't use if you're off the grid, either (ie: Google, Apple). You get the full install on your PC or Mac. You also get one tablet and one phone (Android or iOS), and the apps are actually pretty good on those platforms. Oh, you also get the webapps which, IMHO, are better than the Google or Apple counterparts. Same familiar interface as the desktop/laptop applications, which is nice.

If you need more than one license, there is the Home version. It's about $20 off Microsoft's price, and you get five of everything instead of just one.",A no-brainer for cloud storage alone. Office 2016 to boot. $15 off. Where's the downside?,1498176000,3,

For some reason macros for earlier versions do not work, and if you write a macro that has anything to do with Find/Replace, it will not behave in a similar fashion to earlier versions. This is partly because the people who designed 365 assume users of no particular skill, who are content to use Word just the way it comes out of the box. In other words, Word 365 is more automated, less kindly about those who want to tailor it to do specialized functions. I'm sure that people who are conversant in Visual Basic will have better luck. I am not, and will go back to an earlier version of Word (Everything up to 2010 worked perfectly.)

Again (check below for more), there is little I can discover in Word 365 that warrants a subscription. That you are renting it year by year, from my point of view, is just another Microsoft scam.

I would strongly recommend anyone who has used earlier versions of Office (probably up to 2007 for PC) to stick with the older versions. Although I am still in the free trial period, I find Office 365 Word the most bloated, difficult to use, counterintuitive program of any writing program I have ever used. I think what the designers had in mind was the ultimate ""automated"" program possible--imagine a car with swerve control, automatic parallel parking, object detection, automatic braking. That is what 365 Word is. The ribbon by itself hoards the screen. Though retractable, you will not easily be very productive as you will be spending most of your time searching for the functions that, as far as I know were available in the classic menu in the version previous to 2010. The program is so fully automated that it is human proof. There might be workarounds, but I have as of yet been able to work with its newly designed ""styles"" which they splash across the screen as if, writing were nothing more than prettifying your page. My sense is that the programmers are ""peachy proud"" of all the new features they have built into this mayhem.  You can, of course, after you pay Microsoft for your annual prescription, buy downloadable ""classic menu"" software--that too will cost you, and then, you can buy book, reference books that you can read late into the night.  My question would be why would anyone put money out for a program that is as difficult as learning a new language. And why would a user of  Word all the way back to the '97 version have to dedicated so very much time to relearning what is meant to perform the simple function of writing.
Perhaps you have the time. I'm going back to the 2003 version.

I have since added the classical menu, courtesy of [...] I am still in the 15 day free trial period, but the classical drop-down menu does improve the ease of use of Word 365. The Classical Menu software even has a couple of functions that are not listed in the ribbon menu. I have updated my rating for 365 to two stars. Still a difficult program for us long time users who used to enjoy the transparency of the older versions.

Aug 1. Update. Again, I would warn the user of earlier versions to expect the unexpected. Since I last updated this review, two strange factors  have occurred. First, Word 365 stripped out macros I wrote in my desktop (I followed instructions, went to options/trust/and enabled all macros). It worked on my laptop but not my desktop. Second, for reasons unknown to me, suddenly Word 365 started saving my docx in 365 format and not 93-97. More strange, if you go to your folders from 365, it won't show anything but your 365 formats. This is not true if you go to your microsoft windows view.
Also, I wish to note, that Word, if like me, you have Windows 7 and only 8 gig ram, 365 programs are as slow as molasses in Vermont in the dead of winter.
Adding to its slowness is a splash page inbetween what used to be the relatively simple operation of saving your file. First you have to go to a file screen, then to save or save as or browse, or, etc. The file splash screen is  more aesthetic than functional and again shows the programmers of 365 to be more interested in ""pretty"" over ""efficient.""
I do not think overpriced 365 will last. Libra Office, which I had thought lacked a decent outline format (like Word) now has one, and even an add-on program, Organum.

I am  probably trying the patience of anyone who wants to take in a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. Another defect I discovered in Office Word 365 is that there is no option to create a backup copy of your documents with a ""save."" You can use Options, Advanced to save a backup copy, but it saves your file in the ""Roaming"" folder (if your hard drive goes, your backup goes). Of course, you can use the Cloud, but that too is a separate operation. As with the Classic Menus, you have to buy a special software program if you want to streamline your save procedure.

I cannot remember what it exactly was, so I called the installation support number on the back of the card. An (Indian) technician, very friendly, set up a program to access my computer. After he had worked for some time trying to install Office 365 he informed me that I had some malware (Zeus) on my computer which was the reason that Office 365 could not be installed. He told me that someone else in his company could fix the problem, he would transfer me. The next technician (American?) said he could fix it but this would cost money which I had expected. He offered me a yearly service contract for $150.00 plus $20.00 tax. He tried to talk me into a multi year contract which I refused. When I attempted to pay with my credit card the charge was refused by the bank. The same result with my second credit card. The technician told me I should call my bank ""but not tell them it was for a computer company"". The charge finally was accepted and he started  working on my computer which I could follow, though not understand, on my monitor. After about three hours of activity the first  technician called and told me that everything worked now and Office 365 was installed. So far so good.
Next day I got the invoice from SINGH TECH for $170.00. A few hours later I received an e-mail with a fraud alert from my second credit card that they had denied a suspicious charge of $170.00
I have not received from SINGH TECH any information what was done to remove the virus nor do I know what the service contract entails. I have only received a customer code and a telephone number from the first technician.
My computer, after I upgraded to Win 10, started freezing up occasionally ( about once a day), a nuisance but since it was rare I accepted it. The equipment is some years old, it still works but I cannot get drivers for Win 10 anymore.

I was concerned by the mixed reviews of this product on Amazon, but they were misleading: renewal was super-easy. And with Amazon Prime, I received the product the day I ordered it.

At first, I was a little concerned that I was sent a Product Key for a '1 year subscription for 1 household' 'Spanish and English' 'Office 365 Home Premium'. Before opening the package, I called Microsoft. They confirmed that this was good for the US market and not some product licensed for a different geography.

To renew, I searched for 'Renew Office 365 for Home'. I selected 'Buy another year of Office from a Retail store'. I followed the instructions: I went to the link provided, entered the 25 character code I received. I pressed Next. Surprise! I was done. (The instructions said that I would need to enter the Microsoft account associated with Office 365, but the registration page knew who I was because I was logged into my Microsoft Account on a different window.)

And yes, the subscription was EXTENDED for 1 year, not set to 1 year from the date I went through this procedure. Separately, I read that you can extend for up to five years, if you are so inclined.

I had Office 2013 installed so was already happy. I was convinced I would get 24/7 support by either phone, chat, or email.  Lie.  Yes, there there is a support line somewhere in the eastern hemisphere.  The people on the other end of the line are trained in two things:  1.  Hanging up on you (it has happened to me three times, then MS sends me a survey asking about my support experience)  2.  Saying, ""...that type of support is outside our support boundary."" ...new term for me: Support Boundary.  The support you get is technical only.  That is, if you have a problem getting one of the programs to install. If you want help using the program, you will get this response, ""Sir, go on the Web and find www.office.com/training. There you will find some garbage that says ""We are creating more modules every day.""  I would give it one star, but the saving grace is the included OneDrive TB of memory.

When the key code arrived, I updated it to my account and then handed the card to my son, assuming that this worked like every other multi-computer key coded software on the planet. It doesn't. My account changed to reflect that my subscription expired and my son's sign-up created a new account. I didn't know about this until MS contacted me to let me know that my service had expired. I followed their instructions and the date simply did not update - no explanation of why or what happened. No error message. The process simply didn't result in an updated expiration date.

So after sorting through MS web pages for 20 minutes to actually get service I could contact, I chatted with online help, who seemed confused themselves, didn't answer my questions and who ended the chat without helping 10 minutes later. How do they expect a customer not to be frustrated by the time they even find access to online chat? Just because they don't know the answers themselves, they could check with someone else rather than ending the chat.

There are other similar office suites available that are both cheaper and similar in functionality. Some even allow files to be saved as MS file types. I bought this product because I'd used it professionally for years. I had no idea the product and especially service degraded to this level.

I was told that you had to use Auto Renew rather that use this package because to MS the product was different than the Office 365 Home Subscription they sell at the MS Store (They couldn't explain how). When I asked what I should do I was told to either start a second subscription under a different email address or wait for the original subscription to expire and start again. Of course, letting the original subscription expire could also mean losing all of our data.

This was confirmed by a supervisor in their support group.
So, the ""renewal"" on the Microsoft Office 365 Home Subscription box only renews a subscription that you purchased from a retail store (not the Microsoft Store).

The product itself is the usual MS Office, not a lot has changed over the years. A few tweaks, they still don't do collaborative editing very well unless you utilize their cloud versions which are far less feature-rich.

679,4,TRUE,"10 29, 2015",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,763855553,,Trenton Bennett,"The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.

The full review:
More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.

So what exactly are you getting here?

This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.

It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.

This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.

Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a.k.a., ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.

My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.

You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.

The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.
The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.
The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.

Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.  And I would like to see managing the subscriptions and installs get a bit easier.",Times have changed,1446076800,39,

However, when I'm trying to activate my Office installed on Windows, it says I've already reached install limit. It asks me to go to my account to deactivate an install, but the webpage doesn't list any install so there's nothing to deactivate. Now I have 7 months subscription left but unable to use the software.

Microsoft promotes people asking community. I did and not unexpectedly it helped nothing. Then I finally figured out a way to chat with a support guy. He collected whole bunch of my information and told me there's an outage at Microsoft server and asked me to wait 24 hours. Now 2 days have passed and issue still not resolved. Today I reached the chat support again, and Francis Philip (display name Francis M) asked me to wait 24-48 hours again. No apologize and no compensation. I told him I'd already asked to wait. He then said, I could contact someone else in India if I wish, because that's Office 365 guy. I thought I already selected the Office 365 category and now I was asked to dial an India number for solving my issue that caused by Microsoft. I told him I'm on a paid time subscription and now unable to use the software I've paid for for several days. He then said I could cancel my subscription and create a new one if I wish. I told him I'm going to cancel but never renew again. He then sent me a number for billing straightly, with no more explanation. So basically he was not willing to help me anything and kept giving me numbers to dial.

So basically Microsoft is switching to a business model that keeps charging users monthly but not a one-time cost, then when there's an issue at their side preventing user activating, they'll just keep user waiting, neither providing a workaround to at least allow user use the software for now, nor trying to solve the issue right now, not to mention compensation.

I knocked off a star because of the stupid installation I had to go through:

Enough on that - here is where you will have problems installing this product:
If you were a student at a University/College that gave you a free copy of Office 365 (or Office 2013) Pro edition:
The Pro Edition is a limited use product.  It is tied to your student email account - or in my case it was tied to my personal account and school account (double badness for me).  When you graduate, finish, take a break, etc - your school IT department will cut you off from the use of Office Pro.

You must use either the new web browser with Windows 10 (Edge) or Internet Explorer when you are logging into your Microsoft account and then attempting to establish a new or revised account when replacing your old school authored version of Office 365.  Tor Browser and Firefox will not work correctly.

Tried to establish a new account with the new key - did not work
Tried to remove the school version of Office - did not work
Tried to re-associate my email with a new Office account - did not work

You cannot just change the email associated with your former school account and the Home version.  In my case I had to call up Office.com support and have them remove my personal email account from its association with Office Pro (school account) and then enter my new product key, associate my personal email account with the product key, then force the install of Office 365 Home.  After the install, Office 365 (2013)  Pro (school account software) was removed and a Microsoft tool called 'Fix It Solutions' - which essentially removed all the registry entries and hidden files related to the school account.

If you look under your File + Office Account then your User Account - then Manage Account - you will be taken to a page where you will either login to a Microsoft account or you will be forced to login with your student ID/student email account.  Even with a new product key - and the intention of creating a new account - the Pro (school) software prevented me from downloading and installing a new copy of Office Home - due to registry restrictions and a pushed download associated with the Pro (school) version.  Not sure why my school did this - or if it was unintended or just a stupid IT department requirement.  The Office.com tech support was able to resolve the conflict with no issues - and I was very happy with the prompt attention Microsoft gave.",Great product - beware of tricky install if you are replacing a school account,1440720000,,

The statement that you can ""install on 5 PC/MACs"", is somewhat misleading.  Here's what I have experienced:
I have 2 Macs (a MacPro and a Macbook) which I share with my wife; we both have our individual logins on both of these machines.  I did a single install on each of them, and then each of us logged into the Office apps to activate them.  When I go to the account page, it shows me that 4 installs have been used, not 2 as I would have expected from the licensing description.

One thing to note, when you first log in, OneDrive is going to tell you that you have a 1TB limit (which is still a decent amount of space).  I contacted MS support, and they indicated it is indeed unlimited space, and that whenever you hit the limit that's shown you'll be bumped up to the next tier automatically (so when I hit 1TB, I will be bumped to 10TB at no additional cost).

We had tried all the various versions of the free office suites, but they were all missing something we needed, such as the ability to quickly and easily do labels/envelopes, or the ability to import really huge text files into the database program.  Additionally, we have three kids and four PCs, and the schools very heavily use Office.  Having the same program at home and school is a huge plus.

871,5,FALSE,"02 21, 2015",A3B2NVTP78WHUE,763855553,,Jeffrey Rickel,"An incredible product.  Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have.  The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users.  That alone is worth $100 a year.  You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.

Yet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets).  This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office.  For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done.  Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way.  If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products.  Office 365 protects you against that.  It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever.

One last feature is the stackability of the subscription.  There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere.  Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80.  You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions.  Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription.  This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage.

This is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included.",2015's No Brainer,1424476800,,

It felt like MS was trying to shore up into income stream by turning us into subscribers rather than traditional consumers (because they were and are). But if you consider this

365 comes with ALL the office products
365 gives you the very latest version of the office products at all times
365 gives you FIVE separate licenses for 5 computers or devices
365 gives each of your FIVE licensees 1 TB or OneDrive Storage
OneDrive Storage is fully integrated into Windows 8 & Windows 10. It also works on iOS...

These features are neat in and of themselves. I'd also argue it makes 365 a bit of a bargain. Some might argue that owning Office would be cheaper over the long term but I'd have to disagree. 5 licenses covering Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook etc. run about $1000 or so. And eventually you will want to upgrade - some people say you don't have to but as someone who has used Word and Excel since version 1.0...I'd say most full-point version upgrades ARE worth it if you can afford it. And with 365...you've got it.

You can get a personal edition with 1 license for less.

Home editions can be found on sale for around $70 a year sometimes. You can buy 4 of them and take care of ALL MS Office needs and your cloud storage for $280 for 4 years like I did.

I've had a long and sometimes troubled relationship with MS products dating back to the 80s. I think I've tasted the good, the bad, and the super ugly they've produced over the years and am hardly a cheerleader for them.

919,3,FALSE,"12 9, 2014",A9J4UURM4OSDW,763855553,,Michael Sandman,"I've been using Office for years, probably since it first arrived.  I bought 365 because (1) it has an iPad version that allows the creation of documents on a mobile device and (2) that capability is supposedly integrated with OneDrive, the MS cloud storage offering.  So you should be able to create a document on an iPad and store it either on the iPad or on OneDrive, where you get a free terrabyte of storage with your subscription.

Alas, while Word and Excel work very well on a keyboard-equipped iPad, there's a big glitch with OneDrive. Large numbers of users (including me) can't connect iPad Word or Excel directly to our OneDrive accounts.  So you can't create a document on the iPad and save it in your OneDrive account in one step.  If all the threads on the MS Office 365 support page are right, this problem has been unsolved for months, and it's a deal-breaker for many people. There's a work-around: Download the iPad OneDrive app from iTunes and open docs stored in the cloud from there.  While that's OK for documents already created and saved in OneDrive, it's no help for docs you create on your iPad.  You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud.  That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!

Apart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well.  If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear.

Having said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews.  When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc.) but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking.  That was a surprise and a great relief.

The opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office.  Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document. If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files.  There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface.  It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it.

So... all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers.  That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash.  And oddly, I could get to the files in the cloud seamlessly from an iPhone, but not from an iPad.

Background: I had a Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium trial version installed on my computers, and towards the end of the trial period I needed to decide whether or not to buy it from Microsoft or somewhere else. To purchase the annual subscription from Microsoft, it costs $99.99 for one year or $9.99 per month.  Instead, found the key card on Amazon for $69.99 (for the mailing option, mind you the instant download option is still $99.99).  If you can wait for 6-7 days, just order the PC/Mac Key card.

Since I was purchasing the license from Amazon, to avoid getting billed by Microsoft in the meantime, I deactivated my license from my account on the Microsoft website. After the key card was delivered, all I had to do was login to my Microsoft account and update the subscription key. It accepted it without any issues whatsoever. Also, when I tried to open up MS Word, it asked me for the subscription key and to activate the license which I did. This process works for renewal as well.
Note: If the office software keeps asking you to update the key even after activating the license, just reboot your computer. That solved the problem for me. The entire process took just 10 mins.

About one month after purchasing a year's subscription to Office 365, the ""share"" feature stopped working. This means I can't email or provide links to any of the documents I create on my iPad-- which pretty much makes the whole app worthless. Normally, I would have simply contacted a tech support representative and had the problem resolved that next day. That's what I've done with Apple and Amazon. Even smaller online companies I've done business with have a quick and easy chat service that allows them to solve problems quickly. A company's accessibility says as much about its confidence in its product as the performance of the product, itself: if they've got nothing to hide and are truly committed to offering their customers the best possible experience, there's no reason for them NOT to be accessible.

So you can imagine my dismay when I discovered that microsoft tech support is totally and completely inaccessible. After searching the app's ""help"" feature with absolutely no success, after languishing on hold to chat with an online representative that wound up being outsourced and clueless, after digging through the FAQs, forums, and articles to no avail, I came to the sorry conclusion that I could not contact microsoft because it did not want to be found. This is a perfect example of a company that knew it was hawking garbage and, after having flung its refuse in my face, slipped gleefully into the shroud of the inter-web-- never to be seen or heard from again.

In short: Office 365 for iPad is a scam.

I tried to delete and reload the apps with no success. I tried to work directly in word online with no success. I tried saving the documents to the onedrive and directly to the iPad with no success. Copy and pasting what I've written into the body of an email undoes all of the formatting, and is therefore not a viable option. And before microsoft sends one of its cronies to comment on my review: YES. I have absolutely provided the company with a direct comment/feedback on this situation. I provided it nearly two months ago and have seen absolutely no change since.

So, in utter desperation, I've been downloading all of the updates for the office apps as soon as they become available, hoping that one of them would finally solve the ""share"" problem for iPad. But instead of improving the apps, the update has only made them worse. Today's update completely got rid of the ""word count"" feature-- a very basic feature that I rely on to do my job-- and replaced it with some tool that allows me to see the document as a full page instead of the traditional view (... wth?). Now when I search ""word count,"" the help feature swears it doesn't exist, never existed. And I don't have an extra hour to spend trying to communicate with an outsource technician. So today is exactly the day that I decided to stop being nice and write this review.

What we have in microsoft is a company so bloated and monopolized that it no longer cares about the woefully shoddy quality of its products, a company that has sold out to join the scam artist conglomerate of comcast and at&t. It's as if microsoft has a whole separate ""Ways to Piss Off Our Customers Thinktank"" department. I swear it does, because there's no possible way it could be more annoying, inefficient, and downright incompetent.

I know there was a lot of ranting in this review, but the takeaway should be this: if you're wanting to work on your iPad, look elsewhere.

Predicting that the entire globe would soon be replacing their desktops with touchscreen devices and monitors, Microsoft began designing its software with those users in mind. The best example, of course, is Windows 8, which welded together the traditional desktop experience with a metro UI that was minimally useful to desktop users focused on mouse-and-keyboard productivity. After a deluge of criticism, much of it deserved, Microsoft backtracked and began releasing updates to the OS that reintroduced features and options more suited to the desktop user (like the ability to boot straight to the desktop). Windows 8.1 was a big step in the right direction for those of us who use our computers for work rather than play, and Windows 10 promises to be an even bigger leap.

The problem is, Office 2013 -- which is the Office version that currently comes with the Office 365 subscription -- has the same problem as the initial Windows 8. Regardless of what the spokespeople at Microsoft will say, this office suite was designed with tablet users in mind. On a tablet, the Office 2013 experience is excellent, even elegantly simple and beautiful. Great new features, like synching office settings across multiple devices and greater integration with the OneDrive cloud (a service that I'm a huge fan of), add value. On a desktop, however, it delivers the equivalent of the experience that the metro interface of Windows 8 did. All of its aesthetic design strengths become weaknesses on a 22 inch non-touch monitor. It just seems clunky, out of place, and half baked.

The first thing professional users will notice is that there is an awful lot of white space in Outlook.  Things just seem bigger. And it's no accident: the scaling of the software was designed with high-dpi screens (like tablets) in mind. When using Outlook on a normal desktop monitor, you end up reading emails where the name of the sender is an unnaturally large font size. The calendar is no longer visible in the main inbox display, instead replaced by more white space and the aforementioned large font (again, something that makes sense on a higher-dpi display). In other words, everything seems out of proportion. Let me rephrase that -- everything IS out of proportion.

What is worse is the rendering of the fonts. Although this is a problem that actually occurs on all of MS's native application programs in Windows 8. X, it is particularly annoying with Word. After all, I can easily install a different web browser to bypass Internet Explorer, but MS Word is a different beast entirely. In geek language, what MS did was opt to use grayscale font aliasing in these programs instead of the RGB font rendering of its older API. The result, once more, is a great experience on a tablet. On a desktop? Fonts seem just a tad blurry or hazy. Basically the result is that Office 2013 on a desktop gives you the same font experience you would have had if you had ever deselected the ClearType option on any sort of LCD panel running Windows in the 2000s.

What to say about this piece of software then? Well, I uninstalled Office 2013 and reinstalled my old Office 2010. The problem with 2013 isn't that it does away with the Aeroglass appearance, which I like but am not particularly committed to. My problem is that it does away with it for all the wrong reasons: to create a better experience for tablet users. Yet the people most likely so sit down and work for extended periods of time with MS productivity software - like Office - are likely to be those NOT working on tablets, but instead working on good ol' fashioned mouse-and-keyboard systems.

MS is fixing its mistakes with Windows 8. It's time they start doing the same with Office 2013, which seems to be fossilizing the mistakes that Windows 8 eliminated over a year ago. Until it does, I am sticking with Office 2010.

EDIT: I wanted to update this to account for the fact that I have tried out Office 2016, and it has the exact same font issue that Office 2013 had. So if you subscribe to MS Office 365, and you have a nice desktop monitor, you'll be experiencing the same antedeluvian font rendering effects. Terrible.

I paid Microsoft for a 1 month subscription of Office 365 Home Premium, then purchased one of these 1 year subscription cards to extend my subscription for another year. That didn't work out as planned.

I signed up for 1 month of Office 365 on 8/23/2014 with an expiration date of 9/23/2014. I applied this key card on 9/6/2014 and it showed an expiration date of 10/5/2015. What the heck?! Shouldn't it extend my subscription until 10/23/2015??? The short answer is NO.

I contacted Microsoft support and had a very long chat with an agent before discovering that the key card I purchased was for a 1 year free TRIAL of Office 365. I had already purchased a 1 month subscription, and then started a TRIAL that would run concurrently with my paid subscription. The TRIAL does not extend a subscription. I reviewed the listing on Amazon and the packaging of the key card and did not find any indication that what I had purchased was a repacked TRIAL of Office 365, but that's what it is.

The IDEA of having copies of office on multiple computers and saving your files to one drive is terrific. With that, you don't have to remember which computer has which document. If you are working on something large, like a book, you can work on it at whichever computer is available. This is a tremendous potential benefit.

The current execution of that idea can be a nightmare.

I cannot tell you how many times I have had to sort out which version is my current version, and which version was the previous version.

After using this software for hours at a time most days over 5 months, I still find it difficult to know the correct answer when I open a document and face the dreaded question ""Which do you want to keep? Keep server version, or Keep My version"". Apparently one of those didn't get my changes. Just yesterday I saved a document which appeared to both save and upload correctly. Then this morning I was faced with the dreaded question. As both saving locally appeared to work, as well as uploading, shouldn't they both have my changes? I chose ""Keep my version"", since saving locally seemed more likely to have succeeded. Wrong! All my changes were gone. Ironically, they really had been uploaded, as I could find the changes in the previous version on the onedrive website.

Writing something like a book this sort of issue can be dramatically more painful. What if the last time you touched it (a week ago) you made important but key updates in a few places, but you don't recall what they were anymore?

****Long Version****
My wife and are are busy professionals with very different schedules. We've come to see time as a valuable commodity and needed to have a calendar experience that could be shared across all of our devices. We were both very familiar with Outlook, so we researched Office 365. Given the cloud functionality, OneDrive with 1TB each, and regular updates to the newest versions, it seemed like the best option for us. I use a PC at home and a ThinkPad for work when I travel. She uses a Macbook Air and an iMac. Little did we know that Microsoft has decided to stop supporting (or at least poorly support) their Mac products.

I received the product key in the mail, started it up, and downloaded everything into my PC first. I set up both of our webapp accounts and shared some calendars. I then started working on her iMac next. This is where I ran into a problem. After a couple hours of trying, I just could not find a way to cloudshare anything between my PC, our webapps, and her Outlook account.

I figured that it was some problem on my end. I'm used to troubleshooting things, so I started working on it. After spending another 3-4 hours on it myself unsuccessfully, I finally decided to contact Microsoft. Know that I fully updated everything and explored the online tech support. First, I was directed by an online chat tech to the phone support line. There, I was told that they NO LONGER have a tech support phone line. That's right, if you buy a Microsoft product for your Apple products, you are a second class citizen. You no long have access to a live person!

As for what Mac tech support was available, she first directed me to a site that no longer worked. When I explained this, she carefully spelled it out again (as if I couldn't figure it out), then seemed surprised it still didn't work. She had to troubleshoot this, before finally finding the NEW Mac support site.

The new site mostly contained things I had already found. Microsoft basically continued to lead me to believe that there was some way to make all of this work between a Mac and a PC.  Eventually, I had to go to the community forums. After about an hour of searching there, I discovered that there is no way to do what the product says it does. Office 365 CANNOT share with iMacs or Macbooks. You get an older, outdated product that somehow is advertised as ""new."" Basically, its Office 2011 for Mac, which we already purchased for her three years ago! The WHOLE REASON we bought Office 365 to begin with was to have products that could work together among my Windows PC and Thinkpad and her iMac and Macbook

This borders on false advertising. Its appalling that there is no explanation of this anywhere, not even on the Microsoft website. They do not tell their support team this and I doubt their sales team knows either.  After some searching, I did find out that we could spend additional money ($4 a month) to own our own Exchange account to make this work. That is the only way. I'm debating just biting the bullet, but it would make me more angry to let them extort more money out of money to use an inferior product that I already paid for previously.

Macs get an inferior product from four years ago as a part of Office 365 that has no cloud functionality. If you want to do what Office 365 says it does, with Macs AND PCs, you need to pay more money ($4 a month) to rent your own exchange server for each person with a Mac account. Thus, this will cost you at least $196 a year, rather than the $100 Office365 advertises. Basically, THIS DOES NOT SHARE WITH MACS",DO NOT purchase if you expect to cloudshare everything in a mixed Mac and PC household!,1406678400,7,

I used it for about a week. I haven't used it since.

While they did an excellent job nailing the interface on iOS, there are a lot of features that are missing. Drawing tables in Word, for instance, is nowhere near as robust as what's found on the desktop. So designing something like a wireframe or a newsletter is very difficult, if not impossible.

Otherwise, Office 365 is the same Office we've all grown to love and hate over the years. And the subscription model is great. I'd be pretty upset with myself if I'd plunked down several hundred dollars for this software.",Meh,1406419200,3,

2007 was a good reliable system, but started having an issue where my Outlook Calendar stopped maintaining appointment notifications.

After failing to fix the 2007 issue I bought a $68 a year subscription at Amazon which seems about the right price point for the typical home user.  Hopefully as time passes this price point will be available.

Have only had the 365 installed a few days.  That being said here is my take:

1.  Have four computers I installed on, three Windows 8.1 and one Windows 7.  All installations went exceedingly smoothly with 2007 installed.  Picked up my settings especially email settings with out having to dink under the hood.

2.  Only one issue during the installation, one of my Windows 8.1 computers had an issue where (I believe) Microsoft uploaded an older version of 365 to my machine and I had to get a tech to fix the issue.  About 30 minutes to fix from start of call to resolution.

3.  System is certainly faster (a lot) than 2007 and easy enough to transition over to the new version.

As mentioned, if $68 is the price point I believe this is a no brainer buy for the typical home user.  $99 a year seems steep seeing how you will continually have to purchase yearly subscriptions.",Upgrading from Office 2007,1400457600,,

I have my own laptop, and each of my 2 kids have 2 laptops - one that stays at my house and another that stays at at their mother's.  In the past this meant buying 5 different licenses, and go through the pain of trying to swap activations from one pc to another if we replaced their computers every 3 years.  It was possible, but also a pain to set them up and change their behavior to use online document storage so that they could access files whether there or here.  (as a side note to offset those ""why don't you just have them carry their laptops back and forth?"" - one word ""breakage"").

Anyway, it's pretty easy to get set up so that our 5 PCs are all up to date with current versions with the software that they need for their schoolwork, and the online storage is seamless and well integrated so they can always access their files whether they are at their mother's house or mine.

The subscription model worked well for us.  A Basic Office package per PC is $110 - if you are like our situation and have a houseful of devices that's $550, and then expect to pay that again when the newer version comes out or you replaced a PC and had problems getting the licenses migrated to another PC.  Add in the online cloud storage access ease and it definitely improves the cost/convenience model.  Works on PC/Mac and iPads.  I was recently doing extensive business traveling and moved one of my licenses from my laptop to my iPad temporarily while I was more mobile yet still wanted basic edit access to Office package.  When I was back and things settled down I was able to easily switch back again.  Which is of note - if you want to use the Office package for more than viewing and actually need to create/edit Office docs on your iPad you are going to need an O365 license.

I was able to save quite a bit of money over buying the subscription through the App Store or directly through Microsoft by buying this subscription key card.

The apps run beautifully on my two windows pcs and my ipads. By keeping all of my documents in sync across devices by saving them on Microsoft OneDrive (20GB included for free), I have seen a great increase in my productivity. I was in the process of migrating all of my productivity work to Google Drive, but am very disappointed in the way that Google Drive runs on iOS. I was hesitant to embrace the subscription model especially when Google gives it away for free, but now I am a full believer thinking it is well worth it to keep my software up-to-date and running well across all computers without having to worry about upgrading every few years...or locking myself into Microsoft long-term if somebody else comes up with something better. The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.  And the quality of the software and syncing interface makes me willing to pay for this.

Finally, at this time through the Bing search engine you are able to get 100 GB of free One Drive space which has made it so I can keep all of my documents in the cloud, accessible and synced across all devices. The value that this adds to the program is incredible.

As for the Office 365 software itself, I don't have enough experience with it yet to truly give it a rating.  I will say installation was painless on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.  OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is your personal syncing cloud that ties to Office 365 (you get an extra 20GB for free with Office 365).

On the brighter side the office 365 download order page was loaded after I got home from Walmart with office 365.  I would like to take this time to apologize to a couple of support people I ripped into, rather into Microsoft on the phone.  Microsoft should realize that the world doesn't revolve around them for people that do not work in an office(ex. send all files in word 97-2003)and they cannot keep customers loyal with this experience.  This begs the question why has no one tried to take on the Microsoft behemoth with a competing, and dare I say(I said it), office suite.  So needless to say I had to pass on my work to another person and my manager wasn't pleased.  I especially likes the enter product key-login-enter product key again bit.  Priceless.

Obviously, they were each going to need a copy of Office for their schoolwork.  We wanted to upgrade our home laptop too.  Since this allows you to install on up to five PC's the pricing worked out better for us in the short term.  We didn't have to shell out $600 for three copies of Office 2013.

Gone, are the days of owning and installing a copy of Office on your laptop.  Typically, you'd replace a PC every five years, or so, anyway.  Most people would always install a new copy of Office on a new laptop, so you'd be purchasing a new copy for each machine at $200 every few years.  This ends up costing about the same or less if you are installing on multiple machines.  For installation on one machine, you might be still be better off to purchase a copy.

Installation was easy.  We installed it on the old laptop as well as the two new ones with no problems.

Again, the biggest advantage is that (for $99/year) you can install on up to five machines.  If you get rid of a PC, you can simply go to your Microsoft account and deactivate that copy.  That frees up a copy that you can download to a new PC.  Another advantage is that it remains updated too.  No more wondering if you want to spend the money to upgrade to the latest version - you'll already have it!

This version also comes with all of the Office products too.  We don't use them all, but they're available if we ever need them.

This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.

Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.

In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).",Yep - You're Renting Office Now - Get Used to It!,1381968000,,

But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.

As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.

So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).

And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.

Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer. I'm still not a huge fan of Microsoft, but I'm delighted to see them make their products more consumer-friendly.","A kinder, gentler Microsoft",1381881600,,

However, many software companies are doing this ""rent"" the software idea.  I like that the Office 2007 I own is mine and I can use it for as long as I have a computer that runs it.

One thing I really like about this Office version is that it contains Outlook at a somewhat reasonable price point.  I really like using Outlook at home (I have my own domain name so it is kind of a necessity for me).

The whole ""cloud"" thing is concern.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually. If you're OK with that, then I think you'll enjoy Office 365. It's user-friendly and helps bring accessible technology to our society that's increasingly mobile and connected.

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.

Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.

Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.

I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.

So what I'm going to base my review on Is the ease and convenience of office 365 compared to the way the box software works. it is so much more affordable if you have more than 1 computer or device.

  So I'll start from the very beginning with my experience with office 365.

  You get a rather small box in the mail and when you open it up there's a business sized card in the box. I suggest you immediately take a picture of the key with your cell phone that way if you lose the box or damage the key you still retain the product key.

  You navigate to the website on the card
Put your product key and verifies it immediately then you log into your Microsoft account if you have one if you don't at this time you can easily and quickly make one.
  And then you can download office and you're up and ready to go it's literally that quick.

  What's great about office 365 is you can use it on up to five computers which is really cool. and with being able to save your work on the cloud it's accessible to all of the computers that you have this office  on.

  The downloading of office if I remember correctly was about a gig in size so if you're bandwidth limited this could take a little time.

  Another neat thing is within that five computers they could be Mac or PC --I'm in a all mac household and everything worked without a hitch.

And the best thing about it is the price I usually have to have a current version of office on my computer even though I don't use it every day and this seems like a fairly affordable way to do it especially with Amazon's discounted price.

 you can also install it on up to five smartphones as well --it actually works with the iPhone .I only played with it for a little bit on there, I don't see me using it very often but if you're in a pinch you can have it there.

So overall if you need office this is a good, affordable, easy way to get it on all of the computers in your household.

Office 365 w/ a 1 year subscription contains a bonanza-
-Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access
-SkyDrive with 27 gb of storage, free for a year
-Skype with 60 minutes of international calls free per month
-Licenses for 5 computers (either PCs or Macs)

However, there are notable exceptions for macs-
-OneNote, Publisher, and Access are not available for Macs.
-Office 2013 is PC only; Macs receive Office 2011. (The updated mac version is produced the year after the PC version, therefore expect Office 2014 for Macs.)

If you are buying for PCs there are few changes in 2013 from Office 2010, but if you have an earlier version, the update is likely worth it. Similarly, if you are buying for Macs and don't already have Office 2011 it may be worth the purchase, but otherwise wait until next year.

The registration process is clear and easy to complete, registration of further computers is also simple, and adding the subscription to your skype account is as simple as putting in your password.

I finally put it on an 'extra' cheap laptop we have at home, not my own machine. It seems... ok, though I'm not sure what it's trying to be. I have worked in an Office environment in the workplace for I guess 15 years now and am used to having a version of everything that's a bit old (still using Office 2010, for instance). I find except for cosmetic changes, like the introduction of the ribbon interface with Office 2007, that I can usually live without an upgrade more than once every few years. I also am already using what I feel are better cloud-based collaboration tools. It seems like MS was trying with this to be a bit Apple, a bit Google, but not overall much different.

The product installed ok and runs ok, but I feel for those who have had to contact tech support. Been there; it's horrible. I don't know quite what happens when the license year runs out but am assuming the product will just stop working and I can revert back to my installed version of 2010.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either.

When you get this product there is no CD - just a card with a keycode on it. I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode. I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?

Apart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.

I like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about.

For me the SkyDrive is outstanding because it allows me to quickly and easily share my important Word docs, PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to the SkyDrive where I can access them from either of my Macs and also from ANY computer via my account at [...] This also ensures that if something happens to one computer (or both), my important files are safe.

I can also access everything from my iPhone with the Office Mobile app. I also have a Kindle Fire, but it isn't supported at this time.

You can see all of your uploaded documents on the  ""My Office"" web page. You can also create new Word, Excel, PowerPoints there, too. Using the ""Web"" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality.

Unlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document. For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).

The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: ""Direct Link,"" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.

You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

Only issue I had was when I installed it over a OFFFICE2010 64bit version and it choked. I found out the install wanted to default to 32bit and I had to find the override. Once we got beyond that issue things went well.

I setup 5 devices (all PC's for my office and the kids laptops) so the $20/year per device is a much better value than before and I don't have to worry about file conversion issues. Each install is a new download so give yourself some time.

I ordered it because of a desire to get a NKJV bible and chose this bible (Life Application Study Bible) based on a radio preacher who suggested it because he described it as very neutral and simple reference by topics and subjects.  However, I found its reference to be subjective.  I decided to start reading from 1 John and was immediately disappointed to read that the reference notes specifically explained 1 John chapter 1 with the presumption of the doctrine of original sin and the sinful nature of the flesh and penal substitution.  All of these are doctrines that are still heavily debated within the Christian circles (see Calvinism debate). This was obvious that the reference notes in this bible would not only promotes an eisegetic study of the scriptures but the eisegetic ideas of Calvinism.  I would not recommend this study bible for a Christian with a sincere heart to study the Word of God with the spirit to discover Spirit-lead truths.  If you are familiar with scriptures and various opposing Christian doctrines and understand your ability to discern as you read other reference notes, you may use this study bible as a resource for such doctrinal notes.

I just purchased the Kindle E-book version and it is awesome.  I am primarily using it on a Kindle paperwhite and have also tried it on a 7"" tablet with the Android Kindle App.  Each verse that has a study note is identified by the verse number being an underlined link.  Study notes are easily accessed by selecting the link, then you get back to the verse through another link on the notes page.  Maps are clearly readable on the paperwhite and can be enlarged by pressing and holding on the map, then selecting the magnifying glass that pops up.  These look awesome on the 7"" tablet's color screen.  Love being able to adjust the font size too.

Navigating between books is fairly easy on the Kindle Paperwhite and the tablet.  Menu, Go-to, Then scroll through the books of the bible.  Once you choose the book, you can select a chapter to start in, then flip the pages to get to the specific verse you are looking for.  I wasn't able to get the search function to work like one of the other reviewers said to jump right to a specific book, chapter, verse (i.e. Mt 6 4).  It is still a lot easier and faster than trying to finger through the hardcopy anyway.  All the cross references are easily followed via links inserted at the end of the verse.

I have used the NIV life application bible(Hardcover) in the past and enjoyed it very much. I wanted to try the NKJV Life Application version and after some research about the options for kindle, I decided to try this one. This review will refer mostly to the transfer of the bible resources onto Kindle as opposed to a discussion of the quality of the study notes etc.

Up Side

This bible has been very well formatted for kindle.

Study notes swap out to text and vice versa very well and things like searching for a verse is very quick if you know how to do it (Press Menu, go to Index, then type in verse you want using abbreviation. E.g. Mt 6 30 will take you to Matthew 6:30). This is the same as it would be for most other study bibles/commentaries I have tried like the ESV study bible or the Matthew Henry Commentary (Unabridged). It is so quick that I was able to use three different resources on my kindle to look at one passage of Scripture during my bible study without too much problem.

The harmony of the Gospels is also well thought out for Kindle. You do not view it in a table, but rather by events which you can scroll through with all relevant Scripture passages for each event listed under each heading.

To get to the Concordance, Personality Profiles, Maps, Charts, Study Notes or Cross References is not too crazy of a process. Press Menu, select Go To, select Table of Contents, scroll to the end of the contents and select your desired resource. This may seem a little involved but once you get used to it, it's actually quite quick. 5 seconds approximately.

I have not viewed all the maps, but some of the maps I looked at in Genesis were clear and I could read the place names on the maps clearly. As with the study notes, you can move the cursor to the references for Scripture passages that refer to various places on the map. This is pretty useful and has worked seamlessly for me so far.

When you are reading a passage in a particular book of the bible, you can use the left/right cursor button to look at the master index for the next book or the current book you are reading. This makes it a quick process to switch between chapters in a book. You don't have to be on the first page of a chapter to navigate to other chapters, you can be reading anywhere in a book to use this navigation tool. A definite plus!

When I looked at the comments and questions which should challenge the reader, I found them to be the obvious, the first type of question even a beginning reader would ask from the passage.

The beginner should go to a study Bible such as the Reformation Study Bible, MacArthur Study Bible, NKJV Study Bible, etc., that contain many, good, though imperfect and subjective notes.

The more seasoned reader should not be relying on any of these.  He/She should know how to compare Scripture with Scripture, using topical, linguistic, and other sources to search out for him/herself the unsearchable riches of wisdom and knowledge in Christ.

On the top half of each page you have the actual text of Scripture. On the bottom half of each page you have the study notes. The study notes are brief descriptions/interpretations of each individual verse. Of course not all verses are interpreted for us, largely due to space constraints. All the major verses are covered. What's really neat about this bible is that the study notes really help you to see how any particular verse of Scripture applies to you personally in your day to day life. It breaks each verse down so that it's easy to understand. Hence the name Life APPLICATION Study Bible. Another neat thing about this bible is that this bible is really right about down the middle as far as Theology is concerned. It's a bible that pretty much all denominations can agree with. Anyone from Petecostal Assemblies of God types, all the way to the other side of Southern Baptist Conservative types, or middle of the road Calvary Chapel types and everyone in between can enjoy and apprecaite. The reason this bible can be appreciated by such a wide variety of groups is not at all because it's wishy washy on Theology but, rather, it's simply because it majors on application. That's what's so great about it. Everyone from a brand new believer all the way to a well seasoned Bible Teacher or Pastor can greatly benefit from the study notes in this bible.

If you are looking for a more Doctrinally or Theologically centered bible then I higly recomend John Macarthur's ""The Macarthurs Study Bible. Or if you're more the Pentecostal type more centered on the gifts of the Spirit, try The ""New Spirit Filled Bible"" by Jack Hayford. If you're more on the Calvanist, Reformed Theology type then try the ""Reformation Study Bible"" by R. C. Sproul.

I have been a believer for some time, but felt like I was not really getting the connection or insight that I could have with my Standard Bible; the commentary and other information is great for gaining insight! I really like the other features too like: a timeline showing the chronology of Biblical events compared to other world events; Each book has an introduction that describes the purpose of the book, the author, the historical setting, key verses, key people and summary to help you prepare for that book.

In the back you have an index to all the notes, Maps, and Concordance with Dictionary

While I value many of the features of QPunctureII, a similar product, this one simultaneous excels in its study tools for students and in its value as a reference for more experienced practitioners.  Searching and cross referencing is in fact much more rapid than in a standard printed text.  So after the first initial read, this is my favorite means to work with the material.  The printed text just can't implement all the features of the DVD.

There are well designed sections detailing out the anatomy of critical landmarks such as the spinous processes, ribs, and other bony landmarks.  It provides good coverage on precautions to take when needling near organs.  It contains both point-by-point information plus details of the major meridians, extraordinary points and chinese names.  Multi-media features include brief very good resolution videos of how to locate points on the human body plus chinese pronunciation of point names.  These are easily available at the touch of a link for every point.

It is quite flexible as a study tool, allowing one to practice locating points by identifying first the general body region, and then the underlying key anatomical structures that simulate what one would feel under the skin as depicted in the next deeper level of the drawing. (I wish it allowed one more optional layer for clarifying location of nearby nerves, blood vessels, muscles/ligament groups and their names -- with some way to rehearse these as well).  Practice tests can be configured as needed for studying particular meridians.  I especially like being able to contruct my own point combinations as desired for treating particular illnesses or regional pain problems.  One can focus this process to rehearse Chinese names, too.

The testing features makes studying more meaningful -- helps one identify where additional work is needed and builds confidence.  Given that every school seems to have a few of their own ""special"" pearls or point variations to learn -- it is extremely important to find a means to add in notes as well.  This program allows you to do so.

Deadman's Textbook/DVD multimedia program has already proven to be one of my favorite essential resources.  I expect it to be a companion for a long to come.  Physicians acupuncturists will need to be mindful that the points are understandably determined by WHO international nomenclature, and there will be small variations in preferred locations for some individualized purposes.

DRM Limitations

I previously agreed with another reviewer here about frustration regarding the DRM limitations.  These WERE quite annoying.  HOWEVER, the developers of the software have been extremely attentive to our concerns.  They have subsequently developed a patch which corrects this problem and allows the program to run disc-free.  At first it glance, it seemed to be a bit cumbersome to install -- but actually was quite easy.  It does require that the full version of the software from the original disc be installed first -- which was not a problem for me as that is how I had been running it all along.  Then a brief online validation with a key the developers provide allows it to be unlocked.  If one needs to change to another computer there is a provision for uninstalling and then reinstalling somewhere else again.  This provides pretty much everything I had wished for.

I am extremely grateful that Tom Kennedy and his team at JCM have provided their willingness to listen which led to the creation of this solution until the next version of the DVD is available.  You can write to them for the patch at: jcmdvdsupport(at)gmail.com

This patch has continued to work through the first several trial on my computer.  A few reboots, running other software and returning to MofA, as well as disconnecting from the internet after the initial registration/unlock was completed.  I am delighted to say that it is still working fine.

1580,2,FALSE,"12 4, 2009",AFTC8UJT0YZE7,955909619,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},Doc J,"First off, let me say that the content on this DVD-ROM is everything I'd hoped it would be.  Anyone familiar w/ Deadman's hardcopy text (which I also own) will know that the text is solid.  There are a wide variety of quizzes which are useful and well organized.  The videos for point location are great for to refresh your memory on the location of an obscure point you haven't used in several years.  If this was the whole story I would give this product 5/5 stars.

Unfortunately, this otherwise useful tool is shackled by unreasonable DRM.  For those unfamiliar with the term, DRM is technology used to limit the ways in which one can use software that has already been purchased.  In this case, the software requires that the DVD must ALWAYS be present in my computer in order to run the software.  This is incredibly inconvenient.  The main reason I bought this software was for its portability.  This is hampered if I must carry a fragile DVD with me to use it.  If I leave it in my DVD drive, then it makes extra noise when booting up and drains extra power from my laptop.  Also, it means my DVD drive is occupied and not available for other disks.  I would prefer to be able to keep the DVD safely in my office or at home, but this is not possible.  Hopefully nothing will happen to the disk.

The company has scanned in all the pages (including ads, Bullpen page, letter pages, and back cover) from actual issues. A few of the pages are scanned in slightly crooked, but this could also be the printing on the originals.

I thought it might be difficult reading the comics on a computer screen, but after a few pages I liked turning a page with the push of a button. If you have a bright monitor or laptop, the colors should look nice.

Make sure that you upgrade to Acrobat Reader 6 (included on the disk) so that the Marvel watermarks don't show on your screen. If you try to print a page the watermarks will (I believe) appear.

Overall, a wonderful addition for those who have the original issues (as I do) but can't read them because of their value, for those who don't want to buy a bunch of the Masterworks titles, for those who want to see the comics with the original colors and printing quality, and for those who want to read all the issues in color. The cost of the total collection may seem high, but think about buying over 550 comics. That's less than a dime an issue--more than I paid years ago!

Glo is by far the most amazing Christian tool I have ever used.  The artwork, maps, videos, etc that are linked to biblical scriptures brings the bible to life like nothing I have ever seen.  Bible study groups will love the topical sections which is an encyclopedia of relevant scriptures.  Students will love how easy it is to navigate and learn from the bible.  Anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity will find Glo to be a valuable tool.  I truly wish this was out during my Catholic School days.

Despite having a 5 start review, there are some things I would love to see added.  A timeline that followed Christianity through the present time.  A Christian Denomination option for an upgrade, or an add on (as an academic I would love to have links to different writings and additional texts of various denominations).  Inclusion of scriptures that did not make the NIV Bible.

Overall I feel that by using the Glo software, you will see Christianity in a whole new light.  Every person that I have shown this program to has gone out and bought it.  That says something about the quality of this product.

Fowler,"Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.

Things glo has improved upon:

++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are ""lenses"" that ""distribute content over a zoomable interface,"" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.

++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.

++  The user can check out the ""contributors and sources"" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.

++  There is a ""Quick Install"" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.

++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.

++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.

The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this ""revolutionary new Bible"" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.

GLO features:

++  450+ Virtual Tours
  These are 360-degree tours of ""modern-day and re-created"" ancient biblical locations.""

++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos
  You'll be able to enjoy the ""In His Shoes"" HD interactive documentary.

++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos
  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.

++  7,500+ Articles
  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan

Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.

++  650+ Works of Art

++  Integration with the best web content

++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program

++  Concise, compact organization through five ""lenses""

++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study

LENSES:

BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.

TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation

MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and ""reading plans.""

MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.

ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger ""picture"" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.

TOPICAL:  Here you can ""quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.""

There are three DVDs in this packet.  You can now install it on both Windows and Mac systems.  Below are the system requirements.

This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.  If you want to create and tailor your own Bible reading plan in a new, innovative way, this is one program you will probably enjoy tremendously.","Glo is good to go with its improvements to the software so you can ""Experience the Bible Like Never Before""",1306886400,6,

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.

Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.

The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.

This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.

The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.

I was expecting Glo to be one step above Ilumina, and in a  sense it is, but another sense it is not.

Glo is better than Ilumina in the sense that you can go to a chapter and verse in quick easy steps, and you can open multiple sessions of the Bible (and other lenses for that matter) at the same time.  Also, Glo lets you select a passage in the Bible and drop it to all of the lenses to see if anything in the passage is connected to the atlas, media, etc.

What is lacking in Glo that is in Ilumina are the HD animations, guided tours, and the Bible Encyclopedia.  Glo does have an encyclopedia based from Zondervan's Pictorial Encyclopedia, but it is only for some and not all articles whereas Ilumina has the entire Encyclopedia available.

Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.

GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.

GLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.

Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.

The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.

I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.

GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration.

The layout of the program is very thoughtly done - whenever you click on a link, it ""opens up a new window"" within the program, thus breaking your clicks into ""sessions"".  You can revisit a session if you get distracted and click something else.

Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.

As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.

Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.

This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

UPDATE: I recently rec'd an IPod Touch & added the Glo Bible App; now I have Glo Premium on my IPod Touch, it syncs with the program on my laptop.

I've spent two weeks exploring the content every day, and I've barely scratched the surface. The Amazon product description and other reviewers have detailed Glo's content, so instead of repeating the description, I'll share my observations so far.

Overall evaluation--Despite some typos & grammatical errors, this is an impressive body of information. Not suited to objective research (see below) and useful only as a supplemental resource in academic settings, but excellent for personal use and/or evangelism support. Homeschool families in particular will love it.

BIBLE--Included are the traditional KJV and the popular NIV 1984, NIV 2010, ESV, MSG, versions accessible to laypersons and acceptable to conservative Bible readers. It's easy to toggle between versions for comparison. Study guide links to relevant excerpts from the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible. ""YouVersion"" allows readers to add their own commentary to the study notes for each chapter, providing a sense of community and sharing.

TIMELINE--Significant dates from creation (which is identified as happening in 3950 B.C., with Adam and Eve placed at 2500 B.C.) to the death of John on Patmos in approximately 100 A.D.

ATLAS--Maps arranged chronologically; just click on the period. Captions tie key events to places, with some editorial comments. Sources would also have been welcome; for example, the map offers two possible locations for the Garden of Eden according to ""two main theories"" but does not identify or credit those theories.

TOPICAL--Index by ""cluster"" branching out from four main terms: God, The Bible, Faith, and Relationships. Each of these categories has a cluster of possible topics; for example, ""Faith"" leads to the headings Man, Sin, Spiritual Beings, The Church, End Times, Creation, Kingdom of God, Eternity, Evil, and Spiritual Warfare. Under ""Relationships"" --> ""With Myself"" --> ""Addictions"" --> ""Internet"" two of the three articles deal with sexual issues (pornography, cyberaffairs); the third linked article (on internet gambling) is available only to Christianity Today subscribers. No mention is made of other internet addictions such as online gaming, shopping, social media, etc.
So far I've found only links to conservative websites such as Focus on the Family and Lifeway. (Christianity Today is included but Christian Century is not). While the Glo content is presented as objective reference material, the selection of articles will be satisfactory to Christians who are pro-life or creationist or believe that homosexuality is a sin.

MEDIA--Virtual tours are particularly fascinating to explore--click for increasingly detailed insets nested one inside another. Choices are somewhat arbitrary; detail of the Mount of Olives identifies northeastern view, slopes, summit, Gethsemane, and Church of All Nations, but not the magnificent Church of Mary Magdalene clearly shown directly behind Gethsemane.

MY GLO--Lots of neat personalization options, such as a tool allowing reader to create drag-and-drop presentations. I particularly like the Bible Reading Plan, which let me set a goal and tailor a personal plan to reach it.

NOTE-- This review is the Mac version, which requires OS 10.5.8 or higher. I have OS 10.6.7 with nearly 400 GB available, which should have been plenty.

After you do that, there is a button to download the software.

At the start of the download you will have to enter your school information.

In process of starting the will it suggested that if I was intending on making a living trust that I do the trust first.  Fine.  When I did the install originally it placed a ""Free Nolo Online Trust"" icon on my desktop, so I clicked that, then had to register, etc.  But I kept getting a screen where it wanted to charge me the retail price for the ""free trust"".  I tried a variety of things to rectify the problem, including sending an email to them.  I didn't get a response, so I used their online chat.  They had to enter my free registration directly from their end to get it to work.  So if you have the same problem, that's what you'll have to do.  It works fine now.

Actually, that is perfectly reasonable since you don't have an attorney sitting across a table from you guiding you and understanding your background. You need to educate yourself on the pertinent laws and ramifications of the choices available to you before you make your will.

I encountered two installation problems with WillMaker: 1) Clicking the 'Register your product' button takes me to Nolo's page for buying the 2013 edition of WillMaker, and instructions for registering the 2011 product are nowhere to be seen; 2) Clicking the 'Web Update' button that offers to download updates for the 2011 version installs files that break the program's ability to launch.

Granted, I am reviewing and installing the 2011 edition of WillMaker, and the current version is for 2013.  That being said, the online notification assured me that 2011 online updates would be available to me through the end of 2012 (and the installer does indeed install something, albeit a bad something).  I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and hit the same failure twice.  I uninstalled again, then reinstalled without requesting the online update.  This worked.  Still, I view this to be a huge black eye for the product.  Additional salt was rubbed into my wound when I followed the link for a free online living trust that is advertised on the box.  I instead received a notification that the offer had expired (despite the fact that no expiration date is listed anywhere on the packaging).

WillMaker then offered to help me create a bunch of documents, and estate planning documents like a will are only one category of what is offered.  Being offered documents beyond the expected estate planning documents is not a negative, but was somewhat confusing given the program's name.  I guess this is what puts the ""plus"" into WillMaker Plus.  Perusing the box, I see that these extra documents are indeed part of the promised functionality, therefore, no marks off for my (brief) confusion here.

I then jumped into the meat of what I assume most customers want from WillMaker, i.e., the wizard that helps one to create a will.  You are presented with a checklist outline that explains what the process will be, and then you are walked through a series of dialogs which query you for your personal information and desires for your will.  Each page has a right pane with additional information for each question that you need to answer.  Everything seemed straightforward here, so high marks for the data entry aspect of WillMaker.

After answering all the questions, you are presented with an on-screen draft of your will which you may subsequently print.  The on-screen instructions explain that you need to sign it with two witnesses to make it legally binding.  I have to accept on faith that the legal quality of this will is sufficient to cause my estate wishes to be executed according to my desires.  It seems to me that the prudent consumer would pay an estate lawyer to review the job done by WillMaker.  I also suspect that there are free online boilerplates that would allow me to craft a similar document.

Another area of uncertainty for me is the trade offs between a living trust and a will.  Granted, WillMaker is designed to create a will, not a trust.  But if we ignore the semantic implications of the product name, what the consumer really wants from this product are the documents that control the disposition of one's property after death.  To not devote even one yes/no question to ""do you perhaps need a trust rather than a will?"" seems like a serious flaw to me.

In summary, I found WillMaker Plus 2011 to be underwhelming despite receiving it for free via Amazon Vine.  The installation problems are totally unacceptable.  And the final output document leaves me feeling like I need to visit an estate lawyer to review the result.  If the price of WillMaker plus the cost of reviewing a WillMaker-generated set of documents is less than having the estate lawyer create the same set of documents from scratch, then this product pays for itself.  But that's a pretty big if.",Installation woes make a poor first impression,1353369600,,

Instead of me going through the specifics that are already so well covered in other reviews, I chose to share with you additional material on QWP2011 instead.

As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here. I don't say that to detract the value of the program. For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents.

I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them. This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.

For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself. Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love.",For the Price of Admission It's a No Brainer,1327708800,,

I used WillMaker and found it to be as advertised.  However, by the time I had prepared all documents, enough questions had arisen that I decided to contact a local attorney for help with answers.  In numerous places of the WillMaker instructions, the user is informed that contacting an attorney might be necessary and is a good idea if needed.  I learned a number of very important estate-protecting things from the attorney that I could not have learned in WillMaker (tips from an insider, one might say).  I also learned that several of the state-specific forms provided by WillMaker were quite far from ideal - not incorrect, just prepared and formatted in ways that could cause problems and delays for my estate executor and beneficiaries.  After my second meeting with the attorney, I had the opinion that I could have saved myself one hell of a lot of work had I gone to him in the first place.  I paid the attorney for his good services - including all that horrible witness signing and notarization business for which I have no stomach.  The cost for for having him do it all would have been under $300.  To me, given all the time I spent doing the initial work on WillMaker, the necessary change work I did on WillMaker after consulting the attorney, and all the yuck I would have gone through on my own getting notarization & witnessing of documents, the better alternative would have been to have the attorney do it all in the first place.  By the way, I found that once I committed to the WillMaker approach, making document changes recommended by the attorney was not such a simple thing (formatting issues using the WillMaker's ready-made templates).  So I think that WillMaker is a good product, but before you decide to go the WillMaker route, ask yourself if it is likely that you will want or need to consult with an attorney anyway (if only to ensure that everything is exactly right - not just legally right - for your executor and beneficiaries) and if you have the paper-management skills and patience to complete the project on your own.

Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.

WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.

I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my ""final intentions"" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say ""give it all to so-and-so"".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.

I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the ""list price"" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.

Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)

This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.

Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.

For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.

Another thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.

Most likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.  But in the end, I think next time I modify my will or living trust, I'm going to see an estate lawyer -- there are a few reasonable-cost ones in my community.","Solid estate planning product, but living trust feature not integrated",1310169600,7,

I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will. I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print. Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper.

I also find the ""help"" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside. It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent. So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess. Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better.

I find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself.

Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.

The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.

In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.

Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.

Included in the program are ""checklists""  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as ""How to Form an LLC"" and ""How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting"".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.

Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated ""Book Reader"" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.

Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called ""Your Little Legal Companion"" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as ""Moving in with your Lover"" and ""Getting Old."" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.

Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use"".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.

Combined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.",A bunch of outdated eBooks in a confusing arrangement,1294444800,,

PROS:
- Simple and straightforward installation
- Easy to use
- Extensive collection of forms
- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference

CONS:
- fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.
- no index of documents
- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.

(Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)

That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:

First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.

I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).

All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.

I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.

Also, none of the forms were usable ""as-is"" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).

Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.","Really for individuals & small business ...

I could not believe that this offer was real, but it was!  You truly get what is advertised.  In fact, I am still amazed at the extensive amount and quality of the information made available through this product.

The library is based on Libronix search technology.  For this reason, there is really no limit to the books that can be added.

Installation of the library is not quite straightforward.  There is a registration step that is mandatory before the product registration grace period expires.  It is essential that you back up the registration codes!  I wrote them on the CD label, and am glad that I did when I had to reinstall the software later following a hard drive crash.

Another challenge is in installing the books on your hard drive, which you will probably want to do since hard drive space is far less of an issue than it used to be.  The installation of the software does not install all of the books as well--this is a manual step.  The drop-down menus are complex and somewhat confusing, so you will need to read and follow the instructions carefully.

You will find that a lot of Nelson Publisher's information is redundant between books, so that when you search for a narrow topic and find the results in five different books, all five books are likely going to say almost the same thing.  However, what they do say is quite useful.

One of the most outstanding uses that I have found from this library is the KJV expository by word, with word-for-word references to Greek and Hebrew equivalents.  A full expository research can be quickly performed on any Biblical text.  With full Vine's and Strong's resources integrated into the product, this becomes an indispensable study reference library.

The SFL books are great study resources for Bible study groups or personal edification.

Perhaps the greatest accolade that I can give this product is that, despite a year of heavy use, I have yet to access all of the information available in this library--not because it is hard to access, but simply because I just haven't had the time to explore the myriad of information available!",Amazingly worth the price!,1165968000,54,

I own one of the previous sets on CD-ROM. That set had a couple significant problems: You couldn't read the text of the articles, and all the magazines were scanned badly.

This set has solved the readability and resolution problems, but has introduced a few of its own.

The earlier issues of the magazine have their photographs printed vertically so that the whole height of the page was used to display landscape photographs. With the magazine, and the earlier set on CD-ROM, you could rotate the pictures on their side and enjoy the whole photo blown up to full, (although limited), resolution. This set has no such feature, so you have to tip your head to view the photo and read the caption, and worse still, the photo can be displayed no wider than your monitor is tall. You can zoom in on the picture for a better look, but it would have been nice to be able to rotate the pages so you could get a full screen view.

Also, the search function is a sorry joke on this set. It uses these funky dials to select your date range, (what is wrong with pull downs I ask?), so it is more difficult to select an exact date range. Also, when you get your results they are displayed in this ""carousel"" format with the newest results first and the oldest rotating off into the distance. What is wrong with a simple list view and a scroll bar???

As was mentioned in an earlier review, these search results are truncated, so you know nothing about the date, or the key words, or anything about the details of the results. A good search function is kinda important for a collection spanning 120 years, and this one is close to worthless.

Ah, just remembered something else about the search function. When you search for a particular brand name in the advertisements, clicking on the result takes you to the cover of the issue the ad is in rather than the exact page. Very annoying!

So, all in all, better than the old set in one very important way, the scans seem much improved, but the interface needs some serious work.

I did notice that when I checked for updates it had already gone from version 1.12 to 1.15 in the short time since release. Maybe they will see the light and invest some effort into improving the interface. They have already got my money though, so I won't be holding my breath.","Outstanding content, flawed interface",1257292800,136,

There are a few minor things that bother me, however, things that are not explained and given workarounds for due to there only being a 1-sheet program installation page.

1. There is no instuctions booklet provided in the box. There is an onscreen FAQ of sorts, but it doesn't begin to cover everything you need to know, making a booklet a must-have.

2. Many pages have their photographs oriented and displayed vertically onscreen. If a function exists on the installation disc to make them appear horizontally side-by-side I can't find it. Having to turn my head sideways to view these vertical pictures/read the text every so often is sure hard on my neck! LOL

2. No explanation (that I can find) is available on how to access/display the maps.

3. As was mentioned previously in this thread, each magazine page must be zoomed manually since there's no option to lock the screen at a given magnification for as long as it's needed. This is a programming oversight that should have been addressed, prior to this shipping out to retail.

All in all, owning this Nat-Geo set is proving to be a fascinating and worthwhile trip down memory lane. It's a lot of fun, revisiting all of the old Nat-Geo issues I remember reading (and used to collect) as a kid back there in the 1950s-60s.",Magnificent set!

(If Amazon doesn't allow this link here, check one of my responses below this review -- I'll include it there too and maybe it can stay there.)

One of the biggest negatives with this set is that the sideways pictures can't rotate, making them hard to read and enjoy. And there are many such pictures. Hopefully they will come up with an upgrade soon to fix this, as they have received many queries about this.

Although there are some negatives, overall, I am very happy with this set.

The huge plus is you get every issue of National Geographic in a relatively easily readable format when you use the easy-to-use magnifying and dragging features. If you have a 24"" monitor, it's pretty readable as is. With magnified reading, when you go to the next page, it resets back to zero magnification, and you have to re-magnify it. But it's fairly easy -- all you have to do is double click on the page, and it magnifies, and you can drag the text and pictures around as needed.

They even include all of the advertisements, which they could have easily decided to omit. (It's fun to look at the ads from long ago. For example, in the April 1916 issue, focusing on the national parks, there's an ad for newly established Cascade National Park, placed by Great Northern Railroad, reminiscent of the days when railroads affiliated themselves with different parks, to boost travel.)

It prints out beautifully, and there is no readability problem with printouts.

There is a handy readlist feature, where you can create your own readlists (very easily done) or look at readlists that the editors have prepared. There are approximately 33 of these already created readlists, covering such things as various editors' favorites, National Parks, The Universe, The Untamed, etc. Just scanning through these articles, it looks like these lists are pretty good and I see a lot of things I want to read.

One problem with these readlists is that they don't give the date of the article. You see something focusing on, say India, and you have no idea if it is from 1915 or 2005. That makes a big difference to me insofar as my interest. They should include the date of the issue in these readlists. When I create my own lists I plan on always including the date.

All in all, I am happy with this set, and would buy again, since it seems to be the best way to get all of national Geographic, short of buying all of the actual magazines for thousands of dollars.",You can load to your hard drive - Here's how,1256169600,120,

>>The CNG has poor quality control and customer support over this product. It relies heavily on customer feedbacks to become aware of missing pages and issues, and took very long time (18 months) to address few of the reported bugs. The Complete National Geographic will be incomplete with missing items such as:
- Jul 1942 and Feb 1992: Pages missing, causing pagination problems in the issues with double page spreads not appearing on facing pages.
- Mar 1996: Page 35 is missing.
- From 1991 to 2008, at least 30 maps are reported missing. Examples: The World War II double map supplement is missing from Dec 1991. The Sep 2000 map is missing. The ""100 Years of Flight"" supplement in Dec 2003 is missing. The Jerusalem's Holy Ground map is missing in Dec 2008.

>>The Complete National Geographic contains National Geographic Magazine published through Dec 2008. National Geographic announced ""The Complete National Geographic"" users will be able to add to their collection after purchasing the product by downloading annual updates on a subscription basis from the internet. Content updates for CNG will be available after the print editions of the previous year have been published. CNG released an updated edition of this DVD set and a 2009 annual update DVD ($14.95) in Sep 2010. The feature to purchase annual updates online wasn't ready until CNG patch 1.65 (requires Adobe Air 2.6) released in Apr 2011. Content update purchases have to be made through the CNG software interface. Stand alone archive files for the purchased content updates may not exist for archive and repeat/multicomputer installation.

>>Updates need to be installed to add missing or fix corrupted pages such as in Apr 1913, Dec 1930, Mar 1950, Apr 1953 (entirely missing), Sep 1960, Aug 1970, Jan 1977, Jul 1979, Feb 1992, Feb 1993, and Dec 2003 issues. However, updates have to be downloaded and installed through the software interface; there isn't an independent update installer for archive and repeat installation.

>>Either the digital magnifier that comes with the software or the maximum zoom needs to be used to clearly read the texts on your monitor. An ASCII text PDF resolution of the scanned pages shouldn't be expected.

In 2002 NG made the content from 1888 on available on CD but I held off because the software was rumored to be full of bugs, slow, prone to constant crashes and scanned at very low quality low resolution. So I held off until today and bought the DVD version when I saw it in a nice new package, advertised as being good with both PCs and Macs, thinking that in all those years they would have gotten their act together. WRONG! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE SOFTWARE, IT IS SIMPLY FRUSTRATING EVEN FOR EXPERIENCED COMPUTER USERS. This is a real shame because the content of the National Geographic Magazine has always been absolutely superb; but what an insult to all those great writers and photographers for NG to package it in such a horrible and virtually unusable interface.

I followed every direction to install it on both an internal, then an external hard drive. Fail. I tried the software updates and even they also Failed to install. Even resorting to running the 'program' from each of the seven disks separately (which means you can't search the entire collection for specific words or information anyway), it was painfully slow to load each page, or to even try to turn each page because it does two or three and then the 'program' invariably seizes up or crashes. And this on a brand new Macbook Pro. Fail! The text is UNSEARCHABLE because NG- unbelievably - scanned all those magazines improperly at such low quality and haven't, it seems, gone back to try to fix this root of so many problems. Fail and CHEAP! And their 'Enhance Text' feature is virtually worthless. I'm young so I can't even imagine what a chore trying to read this would be like for someone with failing vision.

The nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some ""printing"" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material.

The bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents.

1. The simplest approach, for Windows users, is try the built-in Ctrl + Alt + [Arrow Key] hot-key sequences available on many PCs.  Ctrl + Alt + [right, down, or left arrow key] will rotate the screen display clockwise. Ctrl + Alt + up arrow will return the display to normal.

2. There is a free download ""iRotate"" offered by EnTech Taiwan which provides access via a pop-up screen & is accessible from the system tray once installed.

3. Right-click an empty spot on the desktop & select ""Properties"" to bring up properties for the display. There may be an option to rotate the screen among the various settings available.

After drooling about the CD-based offering of this product quite a few years ago, but not buying, I ran across this for $35 at an un-named retail chain, and I happily laid out the cash for it.

Who hasn't spent hours and hours as a kid or even an adult, just thumbing through issue after issue of National Geographic, being transported to places and times so fantastic, they almost seemed like fairy tales.

The content of these disks is phenomenal.  Over 120 years of incredibly interesting and well-researched stories and content we've come to know and love from National Geographic Society, conveniently loaded on 6 DVD's, providing super-easy access for endlessly entertaining reading and browsing.

But that being said, that was the no-brainer portion of creating this product, which would be hard to get wrong.  The ""goods"" were there, they only needed to transform the media.  Just scan and digitize each page of roughly some 1400 issues.  Not a fun process, I'm sure, but easily doable with today's technology.

Next step?  Determine some storage media that easily lets folks peruse that bountiful bunch of data.  DVDs are a logical choice given DVD players-readers are ubiquitous on PCs and laptops nowadays.

Last step?  Design a user interface that lets people as efficiently and effectively as possible access and explore all that wonderful content they so painstakingly transformed into this digital format.

And unfortunately, THIS is where they seriously dorked it up.  They had the Mona Lisa and bought a cheapo frame from Wall-Mart to put it in...yeah, that wry, semi-smirking face still looks good, but it's not the treatment the lady deserves.  Possibly inspired by some other software, it seems NGS decided to design a search and browsing interface from the ground up.  When it works, it's not a BAD interface, BUT IT'S BUGGY AS HECK!  It freezes half the time when I try to open a specific issue to browse (exiting the software and relaunching it usually fixes that).  The search engine/interface is frequently slow--and not just because of the DVD spin-up lag--and frequently freezes up as well.  I downloaded and installed the updates, and although it helped a bit, those aforementioned problems still exist.  When I activate the zooming bar to zoom in and out of the page image (which hovers over the page image), and I click on it to drag the zooming bar, it grabs and moves the page underneath it instead. They could have studied Microsoft Encarta (which isn't fabulous, but it is effective) or something similar and made a MUCH more usable interface.  Of course they could actually fix the bugs in this product as it is and EASILY improve it as well.

What the heck was NGS thinking?  The only REAL work needed to make this a great product was a nice, stream-lined, browsing interface that let people simply enjoy the product they've slowly crafted over the last 120 years.  How could they ignore the last critical piece of the project, and rush this thing to market?  Ouch.  And given the fact other reviews indicated these problems from late last year (2009) and they STILL haven't been fixed as of May 2010, it's WAY bad mark on their reputation for quality that NGS should value more than this product indicates they do.

Lastly, I somewhat agree with the comments about the text quality.  Easily think it could have been better, but for me it's fairly readable after some zooming.

Even with all the above-mentioned problems, and several content omissions ID'ed in several other reviews, this is a very good product.  But that's because of 120 years of hard work, the writers, photographers, and editors put into producing National Geographic...NOT the production team who put together this DVD product.  Had both parts been equally awesome (if that's even possible), 10 stars wouldn't have been enough for this product.  Shame on you NGS...get your act together.

Bottom line:  though problematic, for only $45 having 98% of ALL of the National Geographic issues at your finger-tips is too much to pass up.

And even on a high-end system (mine is an i7 3.6ghz with 8gb memory), the interface runs like a slug.

Worse still is the search. The designers apparently felt that having a stack of magazines in front of you is the ideal interface because this search stinks.

Negatives:  The only thing that would make this better in my opinion is if they could have some sort of side scroller that would show the different pages (smaller) so that you wouldn't have to clink each page one by one just to see what's on it.  Also, they need to solve the problem with the pages that need to be rotated 90 degrees to see the content.

On a machine of this vintage, the software would not load correctly or function at all. While the software's manual says that it will work with Windows XP, please be skeptical.

The most important thing is the viewability of the scanned pages and this set does not disappoint. The original version left much to be desired, but these newly scanned images are bright and tack sharp. I appreciated that you could zoom in up to 2X and the text or photo stayed sharp. Indicative of high quality scans. The earlier set consisted of 30 CDs and you were constantly swapping them in and out. This new version has been condensed to 6 DVDs. Even better, you can copy the DVDs to your hard drive and cruise from 1888 to 2008 without touching a disc. Nice touches are the inclusion of a search feature and a very handy bookmarking tool. Another nice touch is the ability to print a single page or double page spread.
As other reviewers have pointed out, there is one flaw in an otherwise superb set. And that is the omission of a rotation feature. Many pictures were printed across the page and difficult to see. You can always print the page, or turn your head but this should have never happened. National Geographic says a fix is on the ways, but as of 1/24/10, not yet.

I have updated the software to whatever was available as of this writing (3/29/2010). The software seems more like a beta version than a production-ready version. I've been kicked out a few times and it otherwise locks up periodically. I am running off the DVDs; I have not copied any of the disks to my hard drive. Consequently, moving from page to page is slow. Trying to back up to refer to a map or recall a fact is not something you want to do. Lock ups occur when trying to quickly scoot past several pages.

Even if paging were fast, there are other problems. I expect there to be a class action lawsuit against NG owing to the mass outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome that is inevitable.  The text is unreadably small as presented, so I double-click twice ON EACH AND EVERY 2-PAGE sheet to magnify the text so I can read it. Then I must click and drag each page 2 or 3 times to move from top to bottom, and then a few more times to move to the top of the next column; the mouse scroll wheel is not active. A few book marks have thrown me to the magazine cover rather than to the desired page. As I progress through an issue, I have to create a new book mark at each stopping point as there is no quick way to reset an existing book mark.

If you are accustomed to an eReader like Kindle, the whole interface will seem like two steps backward. If this software is your first foray into reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer, then you will think that a computer is not suitable for reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer. For reference reading, the absence of any way to copy text from the page, or add notes to the text, makes this a poor reference tool.

My lone comment on the content stems from my attempt to begin reading from the very first issue. Basically, it seems that you'd better be a geologist or physiographer (term from text) to enjoy the early issues as even the first issue is thick with geo-jargon.

Every one of us, from somewhere, remembers reading them as a child.  Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.
I am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.

READ HERE - The EASY WAY to use the DVDs in an external hard drive configuration.  This works for both OS X Leopard and Windows 7 (should also work on Window XP but need to be tested).

Step 1 - Before any installation Copy the entire content of all the DVDs to the root (i.e. D:\) of the external drive.

Note:  copying them in a subdirectory instead that the bottom level (root level) does not work.

Step 2 - run the installation program from the external drive (this is key).

Step 3 - open the program and click ok when it asks to insert Disk 1.  The program will look for disk 1 on the drive that was installed from, the external drive, and will find all others automatically.

NOTE: If you had already install the program from the DVD before reading this uninstall the program using the uninstaller and manually delete the Data folder and all its content.

I rate this product the full five stars because it is the only collection of all 120 years of Nat Geo available on web or library. Lets be fair, to own this much pure access for only $60 is a five star deal!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought mine at Best Buy for $59 and was told no returns on software, only an exchange. The many user comments are all true with reference to the lack of software sophistication. You need to have the necessary windows file knowledge to make the DVD's part of the hard drive at a generous 50GB of space. Several commenters refer to the Nat Geo FAQ page and this resource will give you the tools for a full integrated hard drive load.
My experience started with a twice crashed disk load. I had to uninstall it twice, change the update settings on the disk and the third time I was successful. To load the six DVD disks took over twelve hours with the last several disks taking the longest at several hours each. I have a 38"" LED monitor in tandem with three more 23"" monitors on my primary computer system. I do a great deal of computer and mathematics as a profession and will not simply give up on a software application because it is currently buggy. Do not give up either as this review states that the final product is worth five stars and Adobe Air will fix or improve all current software needs with a few more releases.
Having used the product extensively, it will stop responding in short time if you click on too many requests for page info without giving it time to load and move forward to the next request. I have a dual quad core system and it is the software as opposed to the hardware that is requiring Adobe to create a larger cache memory ratio for user throughput of info per page. It is pleasure to read the articles and use the google gadgets translator, currency converter and of course wikipedia to make sense out of the depth of content that is the hallmark of Nat Geo.
Improvements would be a non sophisticated and bullet proof loading of disks to hard drive, a right click fuctionality to Explorer accelerators and an efficent transfer to Microsoft OneNote for those who want to write reports and summaries of a search. I hope Adobe will incorporate these requests in the future and I will continue to check for the updates in the product start screen. I recommend the larger over 30"" screen for viewing the wide pages. I have not experienced a sideways picture yet and this may be a simple solution.

Not just the texts, but photos, and even advertisements (granted that earlier issues from 1880's were free of photos).  It will take you a long time to read them all.  All for a reasonable price of ~$70

Cons:

1. The curse of software is that as soon as it comes out, it is obsolete.  And in the case of the CNG, regular updates only improves the software, but not the data because it ends in 2008.  It remains unknown if they will release incremental additional discs that start in 2009.  More often than not, companies release only the complete version that always starts from the beginning, frustrating early collectors.  But we won't know the answer until at lease a decade later, and by then, DVDs are probably no more useful than 8-tracks.

2. NGM is known for its awesome photos.  However, in the digital version, all pages are scanned with sub-par qualities.  When viewed at 100%, there are annoying artifacts around texts and the photos are posterized.  Also the resolution is too low, especially on these map inserts, small fonts are almost unintelligible.

3. Every page is a picture, making it impossible to copy and paste, and thus you will have to live with the compression artifacts, and are unable to do things like copying and pasting to a word processor to view it with real fonts.

4. The software framework is not every intuitive. It has a lot of features, but no documentation on how to use them. So all I do is browse by year/browse issues and read each issue from the first page to the last, just like I do a real magazine.

5. The software is poorly built. The software frequently screws up.  When you switch from one issue to another, it frequently fails to load the new one and shows a blank screen.  You will have to restart the software.

So it could've been done better, and I would be more than happy to pay double the price if they doubled the resolution and the number of discs.  But for $70, it is still well worth it.",$70 is worth it.  But could've been better,1262908800,5,

After I have received it, well, I'm still happy that I own it, but it has been somewhat disappointing.

Instead of rambling, I'll just write it in bullet form, disappointments first:
1. As of Dec. 19, 2009, no HDD install
It's quite slow, and having it read from the DVD compounds this.  The only way around it is to copy them on your user-specific folder, which means that if you use a computer with more than one account, you'll need 50GBs of space per user if you want all of them to access it from the HDD.  The more tedious solution is to copy all the images on your harddrive and use a virtual DVD to load all the discs, but that is still awkward.

2. Slow
I can understand if the images are slow to load, or if the queries are slow due to the vast data, but I just don't understand why the geographic browser is slow on a computer that has more than one CPU.

3. Picture quality
I understand the reasoning behind loading not-so-great pictures in order to prevent some from using them outright, but the quality is hideous to somebody who enjoys photography.  It's nothing like something you'd expect in this decade - you can see jagged edges, jumps in tone, and everything else that screams that quality has been compromised for storage.  I would've been perfectly happy with pictures that they put on the web, resized so that it won't be usable outside of the computer, but the pics look as if they were scanned 10 years ago.

Well, that's about it for disappointments, but #1 is a big big big disappointment since it's advertised as if it can be loaded to your HDD, and NG isn't the same if it doesn't have absolutely stunning pictures.

As for the often mentioned type size in articles, if you have a 24-inch monitor, it's not a problem at all.  On my 24 inch LCD, the articles are slightly larger than lifesize when viewed full screen, and it's perfectly readable without any magnification.  Pictures, on the other hand, are awkward - let's just say that the bonus DVD has better still shots than the scanned pictures inside.

Still, it's nice to have 120 years worth of NG at your grasp, complete with ads and pictures, and able to search it for articles or even pictures, if you can remember at least part of its caption.","Bargain, but very clumsy and awkward",1261353600,15,

You can see all the maps which were edited previouly in another software sold separately.

The only problem I mentioned before was that I couldn't print this edition, like many buyers.

From today, this technical problem has been solved : NGS has sent us an Adobe Air update and now we have no more blank pages on the preview of the printing software machine. And really it works on paper.

With this update, you can also now rotate the old pages of the magazine like on a PDF software, which was not possible when the product was released.

Thanks NGS for these technical improvements, even if it took one year of complaint before they were achieved !

Now everybody can buy the CNG safely for reading and printing.

This evening (13th of June 2011), I could at last buy and download the 2009 and 2010 complete updates, which were not previously available for customers outside USA and Canada. So thanks again NGS for solving this problem.

I saw that it was available in a set on DVD ROM so I bought it hoping it would be an adequate replacement. While all the content is there, the Adobe Air interface is terrible and is an exercise in frustration to attempt to navigate it. The default page size is too small for me to read the text, so I have to magnify it, but every time you turn the page it resets and you have to magnify it again.

After turning a few pages the program becomes non responsive and it just hourglasses for half a minute until it finally displays the next page. I tried it on my Macintosh as well and had the same results. Thinking it might be slow disk access causing the issue, I used the Mac's built in Disk Utility to create an .iso of one of the disks on my hard drive and mounted it as another drive. I still had the same slow and non-responsive behavior when it was running as a disk image on the hard drive as it did using the physical disk on both my PC and Mac.

Having over a century of content in this collection is great, but the Adobe Air interface to access it is horrible. I hope that access time and other features improves when Adobe Air 2.0 is released but I don't know if it will or not.","Great content, horrible interface",1259971200,11,

If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).

Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!

The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a ""copy everything to disk"" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.

This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor.

Our local Costco has had a huge pile of these this holiday season, so I hope this review helps out some of the new purchasers looking for information about the product. If you haven't bought it yet, it's a great deal and an amazing wealth of information and imagery.

While the Novell Enterprise product, based on the SuSE 10.1 code base, is a bit more polished than SuSE 10.1, it's also more specialized, being divided into a desktop and a server edition. For my money, like SuSE 10.1 because it comes equipped with all the tools and features needed to serve either purpose quite nicely.

Linux has long been a power in the server room, with unusual flexibility, long uptimes and good performance, but linux vendors such as Novell are finally beginning to bring the power of the open source community to the desktop, and it shows. The added polish and attention to detail are making it conceivable for non-experts to begin using a linux desktop for their everyday routine.

As has been pointed out, there are some problems with this release - the biggest problem is the update mechanism, which I would describe as broken. Novell is committed to getting it working well, but in the meantime, I find that smart is an excellent replacement for yast. Smart is based on the ideas of the apt package tool, and capably fills the job of installing software packages and keeping the system up to date.

The other problem I see is the consumption of system resources by the beagle search engine. Again, I am sure this will be sorted out over time, but for now, I find that it's better to remove or disable beagle. Doing so completely removes any pauses or freezes on the systems I've tested, and enables a silky smooth game of ut2004 or quake 3 arena over the internet.

One other issue is the app-armor service, which while a good idea, is perhaps a bit restrictive. While it can be adjusted, some may find it easier to simply turn the service off.

With those 3 items addressed, SuSE 10.1 is a very capable, pleasant and snappy OS, and would rate 5 stars. The fact that the couple of issues I mentioned must be dealt to get to that blissful state, are the reason I rate it only 4 stars.

Bottom line: For an experienced linux user, a great OS for desktop and/or server room. For less experienced users, I'd recommend something without the minor nits I mentioned, e.g. Linspire, Xandros, or the Novell SLED 10 product instead.",A great OS for the server room or for the power user desktop,1157760000,12,

Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.

National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.

Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.

These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.

  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work. I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps.

  The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions. For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen. You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button.

The problem comes when you realize that the underlying USGS quadrangles are often badly out of date with man-made things, such as trails and park boundaries.  There is no support for updating the maps in the style of the original.  Still, you can make passable updates -- just invent your own conventions.

You can merge in someone else's updates -- the problem comes if you then get a revised version of those updates.  There is no supported way to do the second merge (i.e. replace the first merge with the newer one), or to back out the first merge (i.e. to remove what the first merge put in without also removing any updates you yourself may have added) so that the newer merge can go cleanly.

The interface does take some getting used to as mentioned before, but like all powerful software programs (vi/emacs) eventually, it becomes second nature.

I mostly use TOPO! to annotate my previous trips, plan future trips, share travel guides with family, and create georeferenced raster maps for handheld GPS devices.

My trips primarily used to be hiking and backpacking trips, which I would dutifully record using an old Garmin Etrex GPS receiver. The tracks and waypoints would be uploaded to the desktop and saved as separate .tpo files. Back in the day, I was plenty happy just to see waypoint times and elevation gains as documentation of my backcountry trips. I would also use TOPO to create waypoint routes (up to 30) to be uploaded to the GPS receiver so that I could plan/program my future hikes into the Etrex.

Since those early primitive days, both TOPO! and I have changed a lot! TOPO! has improved significantly in its featurea. Now that I have two kids and more money, my outdoor travels consist mostly of Jeeping, dry car camping, and ancient rock art hunting.

Now, with the newer versions of TOPO, it is possible to add pictures and notes. In turn, these more detailed maps can be useful as travelogues not only for nostalgia, but also as travel guides for family members and friends who are using TOPO! as well.

While similar functionality could be obtained by using Google Earth or Maps, this map sharing is dependent on ""cloud computing"". This may be feasible when sitting in a coffee shop in a metropolis or even at home, but out in the desert without cellphone access this is not a viable option. Further, Google Map data is only protected by obscurity. Any person who knows the URL to your map data can view it.

Since I don't have to carry gear on my back anymore, I primarily use TOPO in the field on a laptop with an external GPS receiver. Though bulky, it is a much more useful combination than simply a tiny handheld receiver alone due to the larger size of the laptop screen and the ability to search for waypoints using the standard keyboard. My family uses a similar setup and they too find it reassuring to know that they have a clearly mapped GPS route available to them in the wild.

Finally, the most useful aspect of TOPO! is unfortunately no longer available, unless you can beg, borrow, or steal a boxed Xport Pro package. NatGeoMaps recently and quite quietly killed off its entire TopoPro line (including for ArcGIS). Xport Pro (formerly $199) allows the user to export high quality USGS maps in the georeferenced GeoTiff format. These GeoTiffs could then be used in shareware GPS programs like OziExplorer for Windows computers or OziWince or NoniGPSplot for WinCE GPS devices (many personal navigation devices can be cracked to run these apps in addition to the installed street mapping software). It used to be that you could call in a credit card number to NatGeoMaps customer service and for $99 get the functionality activated through a PIN, but no longer :( .

Admittedly, GeoTiff, mrsid, and many other georeferenced maps can be downloaded from state governments (usually from depts of ag or wildlife management), but having it all in one software package on CD's is pretty sweet.","Offline map sharing functionality, great source for geotiff raster maps",1222732800,,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41u2WSIWk6L._SY88.jpg']
2028,4,FALSE,"09 9, 2006",A1GXDAHJBN3C5T,1597750301,,Stephen W. Hinch,"UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows.  Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.

National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.

Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.

These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.

  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work. I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps.

  The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions. For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen. You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button. The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is. Another observation is that there is no EDIT menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications.

Geographic's 3D version. Nat. Geographic provides more features such as greater grid spacing options.

They will both save you money verses buying the regular topo maps (after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink and paper costs) plus they give you advantages if you use a gps unit especially in overlaying grids, trail markers, etc., on the printed-out maps.

The set up is that you start talking about business and technology pretty quick, without having received any grammar and practice that comes with that. You learn words and basis phrases first, but only in the present tense. Past tenses or other tenses are not being explained, which is in my opinion more important than talking business (if I would go and talk business in spanish, I would like to know how to make proper phrases in general, before I can actually worry about business talk).
The word practice and the games are really good and very easy to use. It is also sort of ""fun"" so it does motivate a lot to do it.
The phrases however are a bit slow and a bit confusing, the words are first spoken in English and even I who does not speak any spanish (yet) can notice that the translations are not very accurate (which is in my opinion a very important thing in a language course). Since they don't explain anything else, about the grammar, it is a bit confusing when the phrases are not very correct. For example, the English voice says; What soup do you have? The spanish translation to that is: ""Tiene sopa?"" which I think means: Do you have soup? and has nothing to do with what kind of soup they have......After that the answer is followed, but only in Spanish and is not translated in the help language. There is a picture in the screen however, with some sort of vegetable soup, but the answer is ""Hoy tenemos sopa de ajo casera"" which I think is quite complicated to figure out that their answer is that they have soup (from the house or home made) with garlic!
This course is nice to learn vocabulary and to have on the side, but you do need a proper book or classes to get into the real conversational spanish, because just with this, it is not possible to learn all of that. I feel sorry for people who bought Rosetta Stone and spend so much money on this (since the reviews do acknowledge that it provides quite the same), because I do think that for this price, this is really a good product, they just should promise a bit less than they do now, and they should sell it as a great vocabulary builder, which it really is.","Perfect to learn first words and phrases, but no grammar",1305417600,,

The program CD's focus on teaching words and basic phrases, these are OK, but really don't get too in depth with what you need to know to really learn Spanish.  The real guts of the course is what they call the Mp3/iPod Audio Disk.  This is where they go over verb conjugation and such, basically the rules of Spanish.  There isn't any pretty interface, but I found this one CD alone worth the purchase price.
The ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD game is really lame.  They could have just omitted it.  As I said, the other GUI CDs are OK, and worth going through for the most part.  The Level 1 Disk 2 CD looks like it was left over from the 90's.  I really didn't get too much out of it and it did appear to be information that was covered elsewhere.  There are several different looks to the CDs, so it really looks like they have just bundled programs that they compiled over the years.  I also noticed that some of the translations are not 100% accurate.  For instance, the Spanish phrasing would obviously contain the words Madrid or Barcelona, but the English translations would not.

Robinson,"Before ordering this product directly from Amazon, I did my homework by posting comments in the comments sections of the most popular Amazon reviewers who have purchased and reviewed this product and other popular Spanish learning software.  After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.

Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.

Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.

The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.

There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.

But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the ""vos"" (as opposed to ""vosotros"") is used instead of the ""tu"" form.
One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.

Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.

To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.

The simplest analogy I can think of is this software goes from step one to step three, and leaves you wondering what was supposed to be in the middle. I have tested each cd, some as high as a dozen times, and feel no strong connection to the software. I find that the nouns, verbs, and sayings that I had previously learned are sticking, but most of whats new is failing to make an impression. I even write each word on an index card, along with the phonetic spelling, and then review the word later to make more of a connection. Without taking those extra few steps, I feel like I would have learned 10% as much as I have, which hasn't been much. The review games are hacky,and most of the visuals are crude cartoon drawings. Furthermore, one male and one female greet you on some of the lesson screens in an attempt to simulate someone talking.

The primary problem with it was that it is not a coherent product--it is a poorly repackaged mishmash of other products. My wife purchased this (not on Amazon) to try to improve her vocabulary which had gotten rusty. She found that the first disc was mostly okay, but several other discs were outdated programs designed for children, or wouldn't even run at all without installing other software such as the execrable QuickTime. She found that there was no apparent transition from the beginner disc to a much more advanced disc. If there was an intermediate disc, it was one of the ones that wouldn't run.

The best portions of the software come from a company called Eurotalk. This means the dialect of Spanish being taught is not American Spanish, but European Spanish, which is much less useful unless you happen to be planning a trip to Europe. This seriously reduces its usefulness to Americans looking to improve their Spanish skills for the sake of improving their marketability for a job, for instance. The fact that this was European Spanish was not mentioned on the packaging, so we were misled. And the Eurotalk segments are not all in the same series, so some are for kids and some are not.

Worst of all, the money-back guarantee offered by the makers of the product is a complete sham. To get your money back you have to ship them the software, for which they recommend you purchase insurance and use a trackable method, and include a letter asking for a refund, then wait 6-8 weeks for your refund. If you don't get it, you have only an address to write to to ask where your money is or you can e-mail them. Oh, and they don't refund your shipping or your sales tax. Cute.

Instant Immersion is a great starting place to introduce foreign language to children: 1. It's interactive, engaging and entertaining. 2. It's a less-expensive alternative than other programs.

This is better than a textbook or from a class. 1. Correct pronunciation is at your fingertips. You just can't get that from reading. 2. Associate visual and audio cues to aid in learning. 3. I don't have to worry about the smart kids dictating the pace of the class.

Based on a recent study, it was determined that repetitive testing (practice exams) help us develop cues to learning foreign words. For example, windu is Swahili for clouds. It's easy to associate ""wind"" with clouds. The reason I mention this is that these software programs can significantly aid our brains in developing multiple associations. We see the pictures, we hear the speaker and we determine the rate of our learning progress.

The negative: Discipline. It's tough to sit down and dedicate the time needed to learn the language unless this is made part of an after-school assignment or maybe a homeschool learning objective. For me personally, it is easier to ""have to go to class"". It's a catch-22: I'm compelled to learn by having to keep up with the rest of the class vs. being able to learn at my own pace if I can just sit down and keep motivated to learn.",We love this program,1287187200,6,

The Instant Immersion language series is based on the same learning principle as the Rosetta Stone:  Natural Learning.  It is based on the theory that we learn a language by repetition and continuous exposure to a language or environment.  Theoretically this is true.  However, each person learns in a different combination of ways based on his/her previous experiences and therefore the way in which we learn develops as we age.  How effective any program is, boils down to whether the method of teaching matches that individual's method of learning.

This product contains a number of CD s for listening to role-play conversations and role-play games in Spanish on a specific subject, say buying a T-Shirt.  In this script you will be exposed to words for size, colors, numbers and basic phrase such as ""I would like___"", ""Could you please give me___""

This product also contains a DVD which is essentially a number of photo-flashcards for word association.  This is only slightly more helpful than the CD s because you can see a video of a man and a woman taking turns speaking the language and you can mimic the way their mouths move in order to refine your pronunciation.

In comparison to the Rosetta Stone this product is not as in-depth, comprehensive or as organized.  It is basically a  ""light"" ""try me"" mini version of the Rosetta Stone.  At this price, it is a good introductory program for both the learning method as well as Spanish vocabulary.  It does not contain as much grammar or sentence building knowledge as the Rosetta Stone series or the Pimsleur series.  It resembles a phrasebook set to CD.

As both a Pro and a Con of this type of product: expect the Spanish version to be similar to the Italian version, the French version, the Japanese version etc.  Works well if you thrive with this learning method but is bad for those that are  bored easily.

I am pretty conversant in Spanish, having learned it mostly just from working with and around Spanish-speaking people over the years.  I found this computer-aided method of learning to not work particularly well for me.  Even though I spend most of my time during work hours in front of the computer (or perhaps because of it), I found it hard to be engaged by this program.

Some overall thoughts:

I personally found the user interface to be pretty clunky.  It has a distinct ""Fischer Price"" feel to it with lots of blocky pictures and primary colors.  I found the awkwardly animated ""talking heads"" to be more of a distraction and annoyance than a useful tool for learning pronunciation.

I found it hard to understand what ""lesson"" I should be following.  There does not seem to be a directly prescriptive path that the program wants you to follow, so you tend to spend a lot of time poking around and exploring, which might be entertaining, but doesn't lead to a cohesive and structured learning process.  This is what I've always liked about audio CDs or cassette tapes - they are numbered, and you listen to them in sequence (usually accompanied by a workbook).  You *can* skip ahead if you like, but you always know where you left off and jumped ahead, making it easy to go back if you want.  Using this program, I really felt ""lost"" a lot of the time.

My 13-year old daughter is taking Spanish in school and LOVES it, yet I could not get her interested in this program at all.  I think she had the same problem I did - sitting in front of the computer just doesn't seem conducive to being able to focus on and learn a language.

Bottom line, I think this product is adequate for ""refreshing"" yourself if your high school or college Spanish is a bit rusty, but I don't think it is designed in a way to be well-suited for learning the language from scratch.  For an elementary or middle school kid, it might be a good accompaniment to their classroom work, as it is reasonably entertaining to use, and contains a lot of vocabulary drills and lessons, along with lots of phrases that you can learn.","Good content and value, but I wouldn't rely on it alone to learn Spanish",1266451200,,

The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing.

Hill,"I have used ""Instant Immersion Spanish Levels 1,2 & 3"" for several months now and it is a complete Spanish language program that can teach basic words and conversational Spanish, but it does require a significant commitment to be made by the user. You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc. The program includes, in recommended order of use:

1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases. It can also be downloaded onto an iPod.

The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run. These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod -
2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM
3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM
4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM
5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM
6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM
7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM

8) ""Talk More"" Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate
9) ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i.e. Nancy Drew, etc)

The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they don't really match the rest of the class.

I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan.

I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher. In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.

This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older! Start early and good luck!

Ehresman,"I've taken a total of four semesters of Spanish divided up between High School and College, but after going three years without speaking Spanish, I needed to find a program to help me review before taking Fourth Semester Spanish at the senior college level.

I was disappointed in the overall structure of the software. I thought I would learn more with each disk, and the phrases that are emphasized are more geared towards individuals who need to know Spanish on vacation or while studying abroad. The first two levels provide good vocabulary practice, but do not challenge the student to construct sentences. There are important Spanish basics, such as verb conjugation, that should be a major lesson in the first two levels. I felt like I was spending a bunch of time reviewing simple Spanish words, rather than learning to construct sentences. The creator of the software made some practice games to help the learning process, but for my level I've found the games are a bit too simple, even when I did not remember most of the vocabulary that was taught before the lessons. A lot of what I learned from the software is something that I can figure out by picking up a Spanish-English dictionary. I needed more practice dealing with verbs, sentence structure, expressing feelings, and more in-depth practice with telling time.

I hate to be so critical of the software, because it can be interactive (the games) and there is some variety between the disks. It is also colorful- graphics, sound, etc. is pretty solid. However, for the price the software is originally marked at, I would invest in a e-book or even find some credible online tutorials if you are a student or someone hoping to learn Spanish for scholarly purposes. If you want to learn some basics, and practice in an interactive way to prepare for a vacation, a business trip or studying abroad, then this may be a good refresher in some important Spanish phrases you should know.
In conclusion, the usefulness of this software depends on what you are looking for. Are you a student who needs to eventually become fluent and construct your own phrases? Or are you simply looking to learn the basic, everyday phrases? Your answer to this question will determine if you will find use in this program.

I've wrote an essay which probably noone will read so for those who just need some concise points:

What I like:
-The Level 3, Disc 1 (more below)
-The included Audio CD
-The price at $20 is reasonable

What I don't like:
-The lack of coheshion between the different CDs
-The absurd claims on the box
-The absence of grammar/sentence structures/verb conjugations in the computer program
-The use of 9 CDs/DVDs to market the program when it could all be contained on 2, possibly one disc.

This is what you can expect to find on the different discs included, inclding their pluses and negatives.

Level 1, Disc 1
This disc will teach you the basics of Spanish vocabulary, you'll learn some basic colors, numbers, body parts, food.  It is the 2nd strongest CD in the set, don't expect to be wowed by the graphics, games, or highly research-validated advanced language immersive techniques.  It's at a technological level of probably around 20 years ago and honestly was probably developed 20 years ago but has received a few ""real-life"" actors to make it seem polished, but after watching (and laughing) at the same over-exagerrated ""Si"" for correct answers I switched to the low-tech computer cartoon characters.  The easy games are painfully easy, and the other games help you learn the vocabulary but all are basically the same game with different vocabulary words, so you'll get bored if trying to cram too much in at one time.

Level 1, Disc 2
You'd expect this to be a continuation of what you learned in the first disc but you'd be wrong.  I think the person who decided what to put in the box saw this old language program laying around from 25 years ago and figured might as well throw another CD in.  It has some more vocabulary which you can record yourself saying and 3 games (really just one game style formatted a bit differently) that you can pick out the picture to the vocabulary word, one of the main reason I bought the set was to learn more vocabulary but there really isn't much interaction with the program to learn the words besides looking at the pictures and then memorizing the word.  And I'm not really sure who picked out the vocab words, I've never heard a Spanish person speaking about Igloos, so why would I want to learn it as a beginner?  And is professions we're given an orchesta director but not a firefighter or police officer.

Level 2, Disc 1
This disc will teach you some common phrases and the alphabet, phrases you'll use at the airport, restaurants, around town.  As a beginner you'll want to learn some of these phrases and you'll be picking up vocabulary as well.  Unfortunately this might be the most boring way to learn.  You can listen to the phrase in English or your language of choice and then hear it in Spanish, but it is much more exciting to repeat the phrase into a microphone as well and then you can hear yourself say it, I suppose perfecting your pronounciation by doing it over and over again, provided you can objectively hear what you may not be pronouncing right.  There are exciting multiple-choice quizes for most of the categories, but the 10 multiple choices questions are always the same (random order) so a category might have 20 phrases but you'll only be quized the same 10 questions over and over again.  What scares me the most about this CD (and also Level 2, Disc 2 & Level 3, Disc 2 - which are structured identially only different phrases/categories) is that you can memorize 200 phrases but will only be picking up grammar, sentence structure, and other Spanish syntax by chance.  For example, you'll learn how to ask ""How are you?"", ""Como estas?"" in Espanol but the background picture is of two men greeting in a very formal setting which would typically mean that ""Como esta?"" the more formal way of saying ""How are you?"" is appropriate, but no where on the CDs are you going to learn about Tu vs. Usted, sure you'll be understood but it's such a basic topic in Spanish (and without a direct equilivant in English) that I can't believe ""The COMPLETE Language Learning System"" doesn't have it clearly explained in some form.  The other concern is you'll be learning phrases that use verbs in the form of the present tense, subjunctive, conditional, future, imperfect, and perfect indicative, but again no where on the CDs does it cover verb tenses, or even verb conjugations.  So you might learn to say I want to go to the park, Quiero ir al parque, but after completing all the CD and memorize 600 phrases, not know how to say We want to go to the park, Queremos...PLEASE don't think that this program alone will get you to any level beyond beginning Spanish skills.

Level 2, Disc 2
This follows the exact same format as Disc 1, 200 more phrases and vocabulary, covering school, families, hobbies, computers, sports.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.

Level 3, Disc 1
This is the CD I like, and honestly if they sold this alone for $10 and didn't claim you could reach all your language dreams and hopes, I'd give this 5 stars.  Again, this is a piece of software in this set like Level 1, Disc 2 that just seems to be thrown in, it is probably a good 20 years old as well but what I like about this is it is more immersive, you'll want some vocab lists to play the games but you're not going to find any, you'll click the help button and it'll give you more help in Spanish and you're like a lot good that'll do me but it does for example it might tell you a sentence in Spanish to pick the black dog, presuming you don't know the word for black or dog you click the help button and it show you a picture of a car that is black and says, here is a black car, you brain hears negro twice finds the only similarities between the black car and the other pictures to choose from is that one is black, negro=black, you click, you're right, happiness and your brain makes the connection, with repetition the connection come quicker, that is some good brain learning theory on this program. One of the games gives you directions in Spanish and then you have to find it on a map and again unlike the same multiple choice questions on the other CDs that get boring after the first time it is different each time so you can actually practice listening to directions in Spanish and figuring out where you need to go (a very valuable skill if you ever plan on using that ""Donde esta el/la..."" phrase).  There's also a little gameshow simulation that you can play against the computer or against a worthy opponent, again the multiple choice questions have enough variations that it doesn't get bored in like 10 seconds.  After finishing up the a few other things on the other discs this will be the only one that I'll come back to use.

Level 3, Disc 2
I which this were more like the first disc at this level but it regresses to the Level 2 format.  Yes we can record 200 more phrases and vocabulary, now covering business meetings, finance, and accounting!!  Woohoo!  If you buy it right off the website by itself it costs nearly $50!  So how lucky we are that we can now talk business.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.

Then there are the other 3 other discs:
Talk More Ineractive DVD
This is Level 2, Disc 1 in a DVD format.  Instead of using your mouse you can use your remote control, but I guess you can't record yourself speaking, but you can play the exact same multiple choice quizes now with a time limit, if you could play all the lessons at once it would be great as a sleep-aide.

Who is Oscar Lake? Game
Admitedly, this is what intrigued me enough about this software program compared to the others.  Very few are going to finish this game because it won't appeal to the gamer or serious Spanish learner.  The gamer will get frustrated with it archaic design, the point to click to move to this area or enter this room is not engaging and probably just frustate those who don't play video games because it isn't very intuitive.  The serious Spanish learner will get bored with fixed conversations and the amount of clicking in between the conversations.  I played for about 2 hours and found the most entertaining part where I could turn on the TV and see a picture of a piece of luggage and hear a recorded ad to buy that luggage.  It'll be a bored day for me when I figure out who is Oscar Lake.

The Audio CD
If you remember the beginning you'll recall this is something that I like.  The audio CD has no direct tie-in with anything else, another stand-alone product that got lumped into the complete set.  The audio CD is the only place you'll find grammar, verbs, pronounciation, even instructions on accent marks.  This by itself would also get 4 or 5 stars, I'm guessing the workbook that they also have for sale probably parrells the audio CD.  I wish the software designed used the audio CD as their model because a lot of it could benefit an interactive visual context.  I wish it was designed so that it could just pop into the average CD player, I don't think I'm going to go thru the effort to burn it onto a special CD so I can listen to it in the car.  I doubt most people will ever get to the audio CD which is disappointing because it has the most depth if you really want to learn Spanish.

Conclusion:
I read the box and it says they've sold 2.2 million units at a price of $49.95, that is over 10 million dollars!  And considering a lot of the programing they reuse with just different languages there is some serious dinero to be had in foreign language software.  Maybe all the real innovation is with Rosetta Stone they've made over 78 million dollars according to the Instant Immersion box).  I'll use what I bought for what I can get out of it, not worth the hassle of returning it, but hope someday a more complete language program comes out that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:

I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.

There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.

I'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.

If you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that.

However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion. It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other. You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar. How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40.00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about.

Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program. Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program.

* It is easy to use.
* There is not much guidance about how to use it, but not much would be necessary. (Since you are being ""immersed,"" it's the same as if you were simply left in a Spanish-speaking country, and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the CD's from level to level.)
* It does keep track of your progress as you learn, thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at Spanish.
* For the price, it is an excellent program.

Therefore Rosetta Stone (visual-based) should be much easier to use and learn with than Pimsleur (audio-based), right?? We are going to France and I wanted to learn French before the trip.  I bought this produce as well as a new copy of Pimsleur French Unlimited level 1.

Rosetta Stone:
1. Easy to install
2. Lots of different ""types"" of lessons (reading, writing, speaking, grammar,etc.)
3. The ability to see the words and memorize the visuals.
BUT also
4. I hate the little ""correct!"" sound that it uses.  You can't turn it off.  It's terribly annoying.
5. My pronunciation is not very good because I can see the word and keep trying to pronounce it like it is spelled.
6. When I speak into the microphone, the program hates my effort and keeps failing me
7. All worked well until I hit Lesson #4.  At that point, the pictures because vague and I wasn't quite sure what I was saying or why.  I started worrying about verbs and rather than understanding grammar, just started memorizing things without understanding.
8. Oh my, the ""correct!"" sound became an aversion stimulus by this time.

Pimsleur:
1. Easy to install
2. Two types of lessons (listening and reading)
3. Because I'm not a good Audio-learner, I had to redo the lessons, sometimes 5 or 6 times
BUT also
4. My pronunciation got a LOT better because I was listening to the speakers and not looking at the words
5. I picked up enough of the grammar to understand what I was saying and recombine words and phrases rather than just mimicking them
6. This program doesn't attempt to ""reward"" you with that awful dinging sound

Bottom line?  I made it through Pimsleur French 1 (30 lessons) and am buying French 2.  I have found it much easier to use (DESPITE being a visual learner).  I quit at lesson #4 in Rosetta Stone.  I do not want to go back to Rosetta Stone unless they can:

1. Speed up the testing process.  (A more rapid click and on to the next question)
2. Eliminate the sound they use to indicate a correct response.

The Rosetta Stone Homeschool Spanish (Spain) program is very well designed and teaches both the spoken and written language in a way that provides useful vocabulary in real situations.  There is a lot of reinforcement through images and repetition.  I do find occasional problems with editing where the written statement is not the same as the spoken one, plus some typos.  There are also a few grammatical points that I have issues with, but they do have to do with the evolution of the language (I say 'adnde' in Spanish, but I don't say 'whence,' so I guess that I shouldn't complain.)  The main problem with this program is that it's boring.  Some friends have asked about whether or not they should use it with their kids, and I've had to warn them that most children won't be able to handle more than 15 minutes a day.  My daughter started out very excited, doing 45 minutes on the first day, then quickly got tired of it.

The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).

The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.

In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.

When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's ""search"" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy ""Virtual Notecards"". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.

The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.

Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.

Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.

Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.

The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.

The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.

The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.

The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the ""Personal Brain"" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.

The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, ""how to"" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.

Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).

Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.

The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.

The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.

Some minor gripes:

The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?

Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.

But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.

With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

However, I do believe that certain aspects need to be improved to make this product better - or it will disappear despite of its long and proud history:

1. Their pricing policy is very inflexible. I bought v2010 for about $40 and while I was still waiting for the item to arrive, they released the new v2011 and made me a ""special discount"" offer (one intended for loyal customers) for the unbelievably low price of... $40. This kind of attitude does not make me feel ""valued"". If you know that you will be releasing your new version soon, either offer it for free to people who bought it recently, or sell it at a seriously discounted price.

2. Try looking for the same information in Britannica and in Wikipedia, and you will find out that the information in Britannica is - by comparison - quite limited, there aren't enough pictures, links, etc. Biography articles often do not include a picture of the person for example. Other articles include videos, but they are outdated and strange. I live in Varna, Bulgaria - a beautiful city on the Black Sea coast - and Britannica has always included video information on it which is probably 20 years old, taken from a strange location and containing factual and misleading information. One may argue that a single DVD disk cannot contain current video footage on all geographical locations but in the era of Google Earth what Britannica has to offer is sometimes beyond inefficient.

3. It seems that Britannica editors take quite some time to include information on a renowned person in it. Type in ""Tarantino"" and you get an article on... ""tarantella"" - ""a couple folk dance of Italy"". I wonder what should one achieve to be finally included in Britannica's ""Ultimate Reference Suite""? Google search has the answers that Britannica does not - and it is free.

4. A postal card for registering the software - by mail! - is included with your purchase. Britannica views itself as an 18th c. product that just happens to be on a DVD.

5. When you buy the DVD they cannot issue you an invoice. Here is what they wrote to me: ""We do not issue invoices as the order system that you have used is for consumer sales only. It is not for use by companies. There are a couple of problems here. The first is that the software that you have purchased is only sold with a single user license and so we do not allow the purchase of this by a company as a company is not an individual. The second problem is that we do not issue invoices for these orders. Only the receipt that you should have received already."" OK, I used their site to buy their software, they allowed me to enter my company's name in the corresponding field, and then, all of a sudden, I cannot get an invoice. The argument about the licensing issue is just laughable - I own about 40 software titles and all have been bought with invoices, it is only Britannica sales that feel special in this respect. I said, I am buying Britannica out of the goodness of my heart, and all I ask for in return is that the invoice is issued in my company's name so as to claim back $4 in taxes - but, no, they will not do it. That is very regrettable. It is also bad customer service.

6. Speaking of bad customer service, they never sign their emails to customers. I am signing my name, and the person (or people) I am communicating with are always faceless, have no names and remain hidden behind the neutral phrase ""Britannica Customer Service"". Have good business practices never reached Britannica?

7. This is a major drawback: Britannica does not download any updates to your HDD. They are made available through a special tab, but they are separate from what you have initially bought and Britannica likes to keep it that way. This is very inconvenient. The updates cannot be searched through the normal encyclopaedia search, so they are not truly accessible, unless you would like to search two times for every item.

I like running the software (although it takes a fairly long time to start), going through the different options, reading the articles. But I like all software and using dictionaries is what I do for living. If you are OK with the shortcomings listed above, I can recommend buying Britannica.","Good, But Not Perfect",1312848000,5,

I purchased this back in January of this year to prepare for my up-coming trip to Israel in June.  I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.

So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.

To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.

The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.

Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.",Not as good as everyone makes you think it is,1335744000,105,

Throughout the years, I made several attempts to re-learn the language and gave up in frustration.  I wanted to be able to think in German again, but the teaching methods created a translation process in my mind.  Finally, I decided to give Rosetta Stone a try and have completed levels 1 through 3.

This program helps build a solid foundation of the language because you are learning through association, not translation.  The lessons help you develop both spoken and written language.  As I progressed with the lessons, the content made sense and I found the Adaptive Recall sessions to be extremely helpful in retaining what I had learned.

I also noticed significant improvement in my comprehension and understanding of the language.  And, when exposed to German (outside of the software), I was naturally isolating unfamiliar words and determining the context to accurately interpret the meaning.  (Which I later verified by looking up the unfamiliar words.)

The only negative that I found with this program is with the voice recognition technology.  It works well for the most part, however it has not been perfected yet.  It works by comparing sound patterns.  So if the native speaker uses a different tone or speed for a particular phrase, you must replicate that exactly or the software won't recognize that it's correct.

Sometimes I pronounced a phrase precisely and had to endure several frustrating attempts for the software to acknowledge this.  Other times, I said the wrong phrase, but the software considered it correct because the tone and speed matched the native speaker.  (For example, the phrase was informal ""Was machst du gern"" but I said formal ""Was machen Sie gern"".)

I was so pleased with the results of this program that I later bought Rosetta Stone Italian levels 1 through 3.  I highly recommend Rosetta Stone for building a solid foundation of a language and if you would like to think in that language, rather than have a translation process in your mind.",Highly recommended for learning a new language,1308787200,23,

I do not claim to be smarter than you, just more expert in foreign language teaching and learning. Full disclosure: I have taught French since 1967.

My first issue with this product is that the sequence of lessons, suitable for Romance Languages (I found Italian and Spanish very useful), works much less well for German. German is not  Portuguese or French. It, like Latin, has three genders. Nouns are declined. The agreement of articles and adjectives with nouns is, initially, quite daunting. As a result, Rosetta Stone German lesson presenting elementary concepts frequently require the learner to employ more advanced words and forms with which he/she is unfamiliar. That makes a correct response practically impossible. A recipe for frustration? Obviously. Why do it this way? Because that order of presentation works so great for French, of course!

I have already studied German (that was 48 years ago, but I still recall a ton, although I don't know where my keys are), so this program is fine for me. i know where the bodies are buried. This is by way of warning you that you had better have a firm grasp of English grammar, or be a language professor, or be exceptionally adept at language learning, or you will never use this application after an initial, disillusioning try.

Technically, I've found minor glitches during the first couple of hours of use: e.g., instead of the sequence prompt - time to answer - verification, one lesson has time to answer -prompt- verification. Minor, but initially confusing to me, who have written many language exercises. What would a novice would make of it?  Not very much, you can be sure.

The worst thing about Rosetta Stone products is that the company sees itself as an adversary of language learners, not an ally. They are offensively defensive over their intellectual property. To study Italian, I had to schlepp around a fragile DVD from home to work to weekend home. Spanish was fine. But installing German has been pure torture: Rosetta Stone is not allowing me to install German in Princeton for weekend use. And Rosetta has intentionally or accidentally created an infinite loop: you are told that you can use some of the features without registering the product. Just try! Prepare to be enraged.

Rosetta Stone throws around nickels like manhole covers. Prices are way high. Substandard language teaching techniques abound. Hire a first-rate teacher for each language, not just clueless native speakers. Were I running the show, I would work much harder on making my software perfect and my customers happy. We've all seen how Apple does it.

Rosetta Stone is technologically on the right track. Pedagogically, not so much. These are computer people, not language teachers. Otherwise, they would never  fail to approach each language as a unique challenge to learners; a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach respects neither the language nor the student.

I have no better suggestion than Rosetta Stone for learning materials for German. Beginners, buy only level one. If you can work with it, good for you! Buy the whole course. It's wonderful to learn a new language. I seriously doubt, however, that one student in ten will be able and willing to stick it out to the end of the first level.

The learning is basic yet provides appropriate and seamless supporting materials (flash cards, workbook, story book). In my experience, sticker charts are popular and encouraging to this age group and the vocabulary pace (colors, numbers, shapes, etc.) is the perfect entre into encouraging the young student without frustrating them. My daughter was easily able to navigage the software, despite having had minimal exposure to computer games up until this point. The graphics were engaging and smooth, even on our nine year old Dell Dimension PC.

This set alone is NOT going to create a fluent speaker, obviously; the lessons are too basic. However, there are many, many excellent skills and lessons to be learned by just sitting down and completing one 15-minute lesson per day/week, etc. Not only are there benefits to learning to speak and think in another language and appreciate another culture, but the act of simply sitting down and seeing that learning can be fun has many benefits as well. Doing this on a regular basis also sets the stage for homework that begins in the first grade.

This is one of the most amazing software products that I have ever used--hands down.  I have been a longtime user of both PowerPoint and Visio, but was looking for something more.  Visio is a great program, but cumbersome at times to use.  I was absolutely mesmerized when I came upon the SmartDraw website and watched the product video which makes a valid case about the powerful impact of visuals in presentations.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  The possibilities are endless!

The program in itself is extremely easy to use, allowing one to focus more on the creativity aspect instead of the mechanics.  The layout has the ribbon familiarity of Microsoft programs while still maintaining its own originality.  These software designers are ahead of their time.  The automatic formatting and design templates are unparalleled with anything that I've ever used, and there is no more versatile program out there on the market.  The compatibility of Smart Draw with other familiar programs (e.g. Excel, Word, PDF, etc.) is a huge plus.  I use this program daily in my work, and it consistently puts my finished product above what others in our company can bring to the table.  It is my best-kept ""secret.""  One of the most ingenious features they ever came up with is the VPM (Visual Process Management).  It is what every manager has only dreamed of--a clever way to document every employee's job process so that information is readily available.  I use SmartDraw as much for personal use as I do for business; and my children even use it for school projects on a regular basis.

I have to pay a huge compliment here.  Most websites don't impress me, but this one does by leaps and bounds.  The customer support is outstanding.  This is one of the most resourceful sites that I have ever visited!  One actually develops a whole new vocabulary and insight on the perspective of business presentations from the wealth of information that is available.  Each concept is explained thoroughly both in the process as well as business strategy.  I can easily spend an hour every time I access their site, looking through the treasure-trove of examples, suggestions and ideas within the Product, Solutions, Training and Articles tabs.  Perhaps one of the best values of this program is what it gives to the user in a non-physical benefit.

Drawing all kinds of diagrams is part of my daily task. Now, we use Visio at work, and therefore I have been doing all of my drawings with Visio (for probably the last 8 - 10 years). Recently, however, I had to do some additional work at home in order to get a project's documentation prepared in time.

And because I have been using Visio for a long time (and therefore I know it very well) I decided to buy myself a copy [NOTE: I don't believe in pirated software]. However, when I saw the price for Visio, I was shocked ... and I realised I would never be able to afford it at that hugely inflated price. I don't have the funds like big corporations do, after all...

So then I started looking for alternatives ... and found several that were either free or had a free evaluation copy. I downloaded about 5 or 6 different ones, and installed them all.

Then I started using them ... and one by one I came to the conclusion ""this one is no alternative to Visio ... it barely does the minimum"" ... and some of them were so clunky. Each of them went quickly down the uninstall path --- except SmartDraw.

I found that I could get to work quickly with SmartDraw, even though the user interface is quite different to Visio (which I know very well due to many years' use). Using the evaluation version of SmartDraw I was able to finish my system documentation in spite of me being a novice SmartDraw user.

So, naturally, when I needed to have a visual processor to do some charting for my own business, I had no hesitation to purchase SmartDraw. I had already done all the analysis previously, and I knew that SmartDraw could do what I needed it to do.

What I didn't realise at the time of making the purchase, is that SmartDraw also has a massive library of tutorials and other training materials on their site, some of which I have already used and found helpful.

I am by no means a SmartDraw expert (yet), but from what I have seen so far I consider it to be even more powerful than Visio in certain areas.

There are some aspects of SmartDraw that are still a bit strange to me, but that is probably only  because I'm not an expert user yet. For instance, I drew a Timeline graph, and then wanted to move some of the elements. I found that I could move them, but that the connecting lines didn't stay connected, so I had to re-connect the lines. I also wanted to change the shape of an item, and although the help indicated that it is was possible to do it I couldn't do it (but I'm sure this was due to my lack of knowledge rather than a defect in SmartDraw.

I am also a veteran chemical engineer well versed in the use of CAD packages. Smartdraw beautifully bridges the vast void that exists between expensive CAD packages typically used to produce abstract vector-based process drawings and the high-end raster graphics packages more typical of illustrations and graphics.

If you don't have the money to spend on CAD, nor the desire to learn what amounts to be very steep learning curve packages like Photoshop, but still need a way to communicate your data, ideas and concepts in a manner that will wow your audience (in spite of limited artistic skills), then give this software a shot.

The developers have continued to make subtle but substantial improvements with the package. Some highlights include the extensive symbol and graphics libraries that make assembly of rich illustrations trivial. The templates that come with this package are phenomenal as well. You can spend a couple hours just looking at all the examples and getting ideas from them. The smart graphs are a killer way to take the admittedly powerful tools in Excel up a notch.

Even though Smartdraw provides powerful and extensive exporting functionality, it is a simple one-click affair to get your work into Microsft office and it goes out of its way to make the integration (back and forth for those last minute edits) seemless.
For those who dare to do more, the granularity of the editing tools is all there, with and endless array of gradients, line, pattern, etc. that can be used to create custom, polished graphics. You can even set up your own templates along with common blocks and setting like I do and use them for common work.

Recently, they've jumped on the cloud wagon and provide an iOS app that makes work accessible and easier to manage. This has saved me already from an accidental file deletion.

As a process engineer, my work can be abstract and well, boring to many folks. Smartdraw changes that, making my drawings come to life and intuitive to casual observers given the nature of the graphics vs. simple CAD symbols. It's so simple to combine photos and vector graphics into one and kick off a pdf that anyone can view that you will be hearing ""how did you do that"" a lot.
The package does take some time getting used to. While the ribbon interface is done well, some settings and features can be a bit quirky. I still have trouble with snaps versus grid specs. And a couple pet peeves remain like if you rotate a symbol, it will cause connected lie arrows to rotate as well. There are work-abounds but it's still annoying.

The mind mapping works great and is one of the best charts and really shows off what Smart Draw can do. However this is the exception not the norm. I bought it for use in creating diagrams for computer system and software engineering, creating a time line and flowchart for a book I'm working on, and for event flow charts in role-playing adventures.
The book I'm working on is a fantasy world and uses fantasy dates (1000 - 1200, etc). Unfortunately the lowest year you can ""customize"" is 1971. Quite frequently when you add another event to the timeline only the black handles appear instead of the full event box. You have to add another event to clear the artifact and see the actual event. If you open the sample Police report by Hour and try and change any of the times on any of events the entire chart will disappear. Or if you switch the Timeline format to Auto from Hourly, it'll create a very vertical time line. Switching back to hourly and you will be presented with a timeline and no events.
One of the most frustrating things about creating a flow chart is once you use auto charting either by using ctrl + arrow key or using the GUI you can't turn off snapping to that symbol. Any library symbols you drag near that symbol will attempt to auto snap. If you never use the auto charting then you can freely drop items onto the canvas and on top of other symbols. For the most part auto snapping is preferred as it is Smart Draw's main feature that differentiates it. However I was attempting to create a Post/Postback flowchart; which shows how the information flows from the client to the server and back again in web development. I wanted two small flowcharts in parallel to show this process. I ended up having to drop each flow chart symbol on the canvas and then after everything was in place take the line tool to draw a connection point in between each item. At this point, I was by passing the main reason I bought the software. This isn't very intuitive and is invasive to my workflow.
There are other visual bugs such as when you want to resize a symbol and keep the aspect ratio. You do this by holding down the shift key and dragging the handles. It works fine until a symbol is attached to another symbol by a line. When you attempt to resize in this scenario, the object will begin flashing yellow and very quickly jump from the size you want to the original size. This is very distracting and something you would expect to see in beta code but not release quality. It does resize correctly.
You can change the way symbols are sized by editing the symbol in the SmartPanel or Library. You can specify Use Fixed Size, Scale to Ruler Settings, or manually change but you can't do it for the entire library. There is no way to create a custom symbol list i.e. symbol palette.  Instead you have to switch in between the out of the box symbol libraries (which is a solid list).
Another annoying issue is that the undo does not work on the Ink functionality; it's a completely separate mechanism to the rest of the program.
If you do decide to buy, get the physical media. At $197 dollars for the software and $49.95 to be able to re-download it for a year it's too much. With Visual Studio Standard coming in at less than $200.00 it's the better value.
The product has so much potential I really hope Smart Draw fixes the issues and adds some enhancements to increase workflow with the next version.

I have started using SmartDraw to create some basic flowcharts and value stream mapping.  So far, the software is quite intuitive and fairly easy to use right off the bat.  In places where I got stuck, the help system has been informative and easy to use.  One thing I'm liking a lot is that while the program takes care of the automatic formatting of flow charts and diagrams, it seems you are not limited to just the symbols and elements within a particular template.  There are some basic drawing tools you can use to create ""custom"" elements on your chart.

The overall design of the program is pleasing.  It's simple, clean and functional, and easy to navigate.  I wish Microsoft would take a lesson, as the user interface is much simpler than, say, Word or Excel.  There are tons of different types of charts to choose from, many more than you will ever use (anatomical diagrams, anyone?).  For each type of chart there is a library of appropriate symbols and elements, as well as many ready made charts that can be used straight away if they fit your needs.  The automatic formatting, and the ability to customize the fonts, colors, effects, etc., make it quick and easy to produce charts to your liking.

These are my initial impressions after doing a few charts.  If I run into any significant problems I'll update this review.  By the way, I did not encounter any of the licensing issues or other complaints that some reviewers have.  It's possible that these issues pertained to earlier versions?  So far it's all been straight forward, with nice service and what seems like a good product that will meet my needs.  Maybe the company took note and improved its policies.  The company's website has a complete listing, with examples and tutorials, of all the different types of charts, so you should be able to get a pretty good idea if this product will meet your requirements.  For me, it was being able to see everything included in the product that made me decide to go ahead and purchase it.

UPDATE 3/20/2012.  I've had the opportunity to make some more charts, and I'm really liking the software.  Once I got accustomed to the method for adding, inserting, and positioning elements, I now find it very easy and fast to create charts on the fly.  In fact, it's so easy that I can really use the product as a thinking tool - that is, to work out my ideas in chart form as they develop.  The charts are also attractive; you can change fonts, font sizes, fill colors and shading as easily as you would do these things in a word processor.  The automatic formatting keeps everything looking clean and sharp.  There seems to be a lot of flexibility and few restrictions.  It's working great for me so far.","So far, so good",1330214400,6,

The program has become so embedded into my professional career that I cannot think of being without it.  I have always maintained a license on my personal machine, but have gone so far as to purchase an additional license for a machine at my own expense to ensure that I'm also able to utilize the functionality at work.

If you're looking to diagram, chart, map, or make logical sense of ANYTHING, there's a template for it.  Comparing this program to Visio is doing it a disservice - SmartDraw goes beyond the simple diagramming available in Visio and allows you to actually use the software as part of a problem solving process.  SmartDraw has SO many templates available for you to use to kick off your thought process, and you can always modify them or just start from scratch as the mood suits you.

For those who would compare it to Visio, SmartDraw beats its Microsoft competitor hands down.  First of all, when you connect a line to something in SmartDraw, the program is intelligent enough to maintain that link even when you move things around.  Adding text, changing line formats, aligning objects, changing object shapes, and changing color schemes are 1-2 click functions (most of which are available from the right-click menu of a given object).  It's an intuitive program with limitless possibilities.

This program integrates seemlessly with MS Office applications.  As an example, if you have your PowerPoint presentation open and you have created an image or diagram in SmartDraw, there is a button at the top of the screen to ""send to PowerPoint"" which literally creates a new slide *in the file you are already working in* with your image in the center, waiting for you to add a title.

The customer service package that comes with SmartDraw is also exceptional.  Any time I've had a question or suggestion for a product enhancement, I receive a response within hours without detailed instructions on how to perform the functionality I was looking for, or a promise to forward the suggestion to the development team for a future release.  And since future releases and updates are always being pushed out with new templates and functionality, I have yet to be disappointed.

The ONE downside is sharing images to those who don't have the program.  However, as this same issue exists for Visio (which does a small fraction of the functionality and doesn't come with a built-in .pdf exporter), SmartDraw has and will remain my diagramming tool of choice.

Most of the problems posted seem to result from having used the trial or older versions of the software.  As I've been using this product for at least 5 years, I will agree that past versions had issues opening files and weren't as versatile.  However, these complaints should be posted on the page for SmartDraw 2009; SmartDraw VP resolved these issues by incorporating functionality to push out continuous updates as new functionality emerged and/or issues were identified and resolved.  As for the people posting negative reviews after only using the trial version, these appear to be people who want to get the software without paying for it and are upset that the company limited functionality in the trial to prevent that from happening.  Unless you're reviewing the ""full package"", there's no way to understand or even be aware of the full potential of the software.

What I found was that the program was priced at $300 for a single-seat license and will not do the kind of drawing it was promoted for. And its general design is quite poor, often awkward and unwieldy.  It probably will do some things reasonably well, but I think it is too limited and rigid for general use.

Worse, the entire marketing scheme is dishonest.  First off, they claim a five-star review rating on Amazon, ignoring the several one- and two-star ratings.  And it is grossly overpriced.  They offer a $100 discount if you purchase by a short deadline.  That ""deadline"" is regularly shoved out just a few days ahead to apparently stampede a purchase.  The $100 ""discount"" brings the price down to about the regular price on Amazon, so the whole ""discount"" offer is a sham.  The obviously shilled five-star reviews here are another example of dishonest self-promotion.

There is a basic principle in online purchasing (actually applicable to many aspects of life):  Never buy anything from anyone who lies to get your attention.

Notwithstanding all that, the program might be useful for some people for a limited kind of work.  For those narrow purposes even I might be induced to pay $30 or $40 for it.

8/8/2012 UPDATE I have updated to the 2012 version of Smart Draw and am very happy with the changes. I have recently worked with floor plans, elevations, gardens, graphs, timelines and gantt charts. I was frustrated and finally gave up trying to make a timeline that was by quarter for 18 months. I did a workaround and the result was quite nice. The floor plan changes are very powerful. You can get into a lot of creativity or trouble. For example, depending on where you place your curser you end up with angled walls or you move the whole wall. It took me a bit of time to learn the precise location but it is a very nice option.

2/9/2012 UPDATE I continue to use this program and appreciate the products it can produce. This last week I discovered a new thing it can do that I found extremely useful. There are times when you draw an object in another program, such as powerpoint, that blows apart when you try to move it. I discovered that you can take a copy of the graphic and plop it onto a blank page in Smart Draw and it copies as a picture. From there, save it as a sdr file, go back and so save as, and pick your image format--I usually use jpg. As with any sdr file, you can adjust the density and size of the image when you save it. This worked perfectly for me and when I imported the jpg into another program (in this case MS Word) it behaved perfectly. Of course, you can do the same thing with a photo editing program like PaintShop Pro or Photo Shop but this is quick and easy and if you already have the program open is it is quick and easy.

9/10/2011 UPDATE I am currently working on a project that requires a great deal of data analysis. I typically have the same data i Exel, SPSS and sometimes in txt format. I am working with data with a large number of cases or smaller ones with many data points. I have to analyze the data, convert it into to a variety of visual formats and then save it as a 8MB or larger file for publication. I can graph in multiple programs. I typically move the data to SmartDraw the graphical presentation because it has the most control over the presentation of the data and is easy to convert to large jpg files. However, there are three things that are truly bothersome. As I and others have noted the program crashes a lot. My office partners are used to me throwing my hands into the air and rolling my chair back while I wait for the program to restart. On the positive side, when it does restart my stuff is still there. My computer should have enough power to run a program like this so I believe the ""crash-o--matic"" aspect of it is in the program. Secondly, it is hard to change the font size on graphs. You should be able to select one of the sibling boxes and change the text in all. While I can make this happen sometimes it is not reliable which necessitates changing box by box. That said, I still think it is a good program. Doing the sort of thing I do is not trivial so having to wrestle with a program is not uncommon regardless of the program I use. My criteria is whether or not the program will ultimately produce what I want. I can answer affirmatively that Smart Draw does that for me.

7/24/2011 UPDATE I have been using VP for several months now and have changed my 5 to 4 stars. It is still a versatile program and allows you to do a lot of different things with only a little technical skill. However, I think the previous versions were easier to use when you wanted to do a range of different types of graphics. I have found that the libraries are harder to work in and it seems to me that there were things I used to use that are not there now. Of course, backwards memory is always risky but I think there were ;-). I would still buy this program, and I am glad that I have it. However, I strongly urge people to figure out what you want your program to do. As other reviewers have mentioned, Visio is better or that is better. I still believe that the ""better"" aspects are based on what you use the program for. I think Smart Draw is a very good choice if you use a lot of different types of graphics (e.g. brochures, charts, fliers, landscapes, etc). I do not think it is the best choice if you use one or a few types of graphics because there are limits and trade offs in usability to offer the range of modules.

3/30/2011 ORIGINAL REVIEW

THE BASIS OF MY REVIEW
Some reviewers cautioned that the highly ranked reviews were ""shill"" because people did not purchase the program through Amazon, and/or that they only had one review posted.  I cannot speak to those reviews but I can speak to my review. Upfront I will state that I did not purchase my copies from Amazon because I needed multiple seats and that was not available through Amazon.  I decided to review SmartDraw here since Amazon is a very important place to share product experiences. My review is based on frequent use of 2007, 2009 and recently with VP (2010).

I routinely purchase from, and review products on, Amazon. I always try to write the type of review that provides information to help people decide if a product is one they will like. I am far from the most frequent or popular reviewer but I have a good track record on ""helpfulness"" votes.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I affirm that I have not received any economic or other benefits from SmartDraw.  I have no friends or family members who work for SmartDraw. This review is entirely my opinion.

I LIKE SMARTDRAW VERY MUCH
I think SmartDraw is a very good program and a good investment. I also think there are issues to consider. After thinking carefully of its pluses and minuses for me, I decided to give it a 5 star rating because in my opinion the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I have experienced a few limitations, some of which turn out to be lack of knowledge of the program, some that are idiosyncrasies of the program, some that are just unhelpful, and some that hopefully will fade with time. Having reviewed other programs, SmartDraw is the most versatile program of commercial or freeware that I have found. I am a researcher and being able to analyze data in various visual methods teaches me about my data and provides ways to show others what the data are saying. There is a problem with VP that I hope will fade away but have no assurance that it will. For reasons I do not understand, the SmartDraw company decided to create the new version (VP) so that it is not backwards compatible. This forces you to upgrade/purchase any seat that is using the images created or edited in VP. I have provided more detail below on all of my concerns. This has happened with other programs (e.g. transitioning from Word 3.0 to Word 1997) and fixes have followed. Hopefully there will be a fix and the problem will fade away.

Some reviewers have said that Visio is better. As one reviewer correctly pointed out there is far more information available for book and community tech support than for SmartDraw. I agree that for some functions Visio is a great choice. However, there are things that SmartDraw does do that Visio does not. I used Visio in the past and know that it is a very powerful program. It did not meet my needs for the type of scientific data analysis and graphing that I do. By comparison, SmartDraw is probably not a good choice for company IT management like Visio is. I think it is important to consider what you want to do with a program and then match those needs to your software.

THE PROGRAM

PROS
1. Multiple Graphic/Visual Analysis Module In One Program
SmartDraw is unique in that it combines multiple types of graphics in one program. SmartDraw is excellent for visual data analysis and creating graphics to display that data. I can be very good for planning and designing things like electrical systems, house plans, computer programs, and even landscaping. Perhaps the most important outcome of this multi-module design is that you can enter data once and then use it across multiple types data presentation. For example, you can put data in, display it in the graphing/charging functions and with one click display the exact data in the mind map module. I have been able to find programs that are alternatives to one or a few of the modules but none that work across so many modules. Additionally, when using multiple programs, linking them together is very time-consuming.

2. Data Analysis, Not Just Data Presentation
SmartDraw is not a just a graphics program. It is that, plus a data analytic tool. I use it in combination with a statistical program and it allows me to understand and display my data in ways I cannot with the statistical package alone.

3. Helps Convey Complex Thoughts to Others
SmartDraw allows me to construct graphic images to convey unusual or complex information to others.

4. Can Create Very Dense Files for Publication
You can create very large, dense graphics that are excellent for publication. We often write monographs and reports that are done in color and on good paper. We need incredibly large images (3-8 MB each)to have the quality necessary for these publications and for scientific posters. It is quite easy to do this with SmartDraw once you figure it out. I have never found any program that is similar for data analysis. You can draw lovely graphics for publications but you can also display information in analytic methods.

CONS
While I have listed a lot of cons here, they are most important for casual users. For serious users, there are generally ones that can be chalked up to idiosyncratic program quirks. Like most program, these quirk are things you learn to work around but are sometimes things that are downright infuriating. In my experience, some of the problems I have had were related to needing a deep knowledge of the program so you can figure out how to do it or find a decent work-around. A couple of the cons are serious. I also agree totally with reviewer that said SmartDraw is not a good program for serious, competent graphics designers. SmartDraw is a combination of ""get it done"" and sophisticated options. You can really do a lot with things program but it probably is not a substitute full-bore, full time, graphics designs. It can be a great part of a larger toolkit.

1. Advertised As ""Simple,"" But In Reality It Is Not A Program For Casual Users
SmartDraw is a multi-competence level program that can be hard to use for more complex graphics. It is not for casual users unless you want to use a pre-packaged item and just fill in their blanks.

2. Help Functions are Either Very Basic or Sometimes Hard To Find
The ""Smart Help"" feature is nice but the information provided is the very beginning level helpful to those who are ""filling in the blanks."" Not unlike some other programs, finding advanced help can be frustrating because what SmartDraw calls a function is not always intuitive. Sometimes the information is not in the help files.

3. Sometimes Overly Aggressively Automated
There are times that I cannot understand what is happening with with my graphic or how to enter and manage my data. The automated aspects of SmartDraw can be aggressive; it may reset parameters when you do not want it to do that. It can be tiresome to track these down so you can figure out what is amiss. This is improved in VP. The Gantt Chart module is an excellent example of the problem. Sometimes you set date parameters and SmartDraw ""fixes"" later dates by sending them to the default.

4.  Sometimes Limits the Complexity of the Data You Can Display
At times the program will not accept the parameters I want to use. For example, top level and sublevels can be difficult to display and sometimes you cannot force the program to analyze and display sublevel data.

5. Can Be Buggy
SmartDraw can be buggy. You can be doing something and poof, the program shuts down. If you have good ""save"" habits, the crash is a bother, but usually not fatal. Sometimes it can be a bigger issue. The file may lose its association with SmartDraw even though the extension is actually on the file. As a result of the uncoupling, your files look like text files so you cannot easily spot them. If you can find the file you have to open SmartDraw, navigate to the file, and then open it. You cannot click on the file itself. It also disappears from all locations of ""recent docs"" so it appears to be completely gone even if it is there. A little experience and you can find the files but it can be baffling at first.

6. No Backwards Compatibility (see more below).
SmartDraw VP is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

SMARTDRAW VP IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
In a crisis moment, I ended up purchasing VP and *then* discovered that it was not backwards Not only had I created new images that could not be used on my other machines where I have 2009, I effectively destroyed my ability to access graphics that I had made minor changes on in VP. I do intend to upgrade all of my machines but for now cannot afford to do that so am stuck with a very difficult problem. I hope there is a fix soon.

MOVING LICENSE FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER
One commenter pointed out you can be forced into purchasing a new version if you change computers. This can be a thorny problem. When I had these difficulties, I had the presence of mind to enlisted the help of SmartDraw tech support. I own two seats (one for desktop and one for laptop). I decommissioned my old desktop and then could not install SmartDraw on my new desktop since I was effectively requesting three seats. After we identified the problem, Tech Support canceled my registration for the decommissioned desktop which allowed me to install it on my new machine. My problem was solved in just a few minutes.

TECH SUPPORT
Some reviewers say that they have had problems with tech support. My own experience is that they have been very helpful and meet my criteria for really good support. I recognize that you do have to have the ""premium"" version to get the tech support I have. I have purchased ""premium"" tech support on other programs and have not been as satisfied as I am with SmartDraw. Here is why I like them:

1. They answer the phone quickly and you get a real person.
2. It is possible to understand the accents of the tech support personnel. I understand that English and Spanish language support is available.
3. They listen patiently while you explain the issue and do not assume what it is or that you do not know what you are talking about.
4. They stick with you while you try to solve the problem.
5. They are downright honest in saying things like, ""Yes, it would be good if it did that but it does not.""
6. They will do phone support follow-up by email from a real person. Typically you can stay with the same tech support person through the resolution of a problem.

I originally purchased the product about a year ago to use on a specific project where I needed some unique visuals and project management tools. It worked well for that, particularly the Mind-map feature. When I had another project come up recently, I was presented with the offer to upgrade to VP; all I can say is wow!  The new version is beautiful, has more options, and more example templates.  Without even thinking about the help function, I jumped right in and was making complex figures in no time.  One really unique feature I really like is the export feature.  For example, say you are working in a Word document and need to add a mind map diagram.  You can fire up VP and create the figure. Using the export to Word option, the figure will be copied to the Word document where your cursor was placed when you left the document - a really handy feature.

This used to be the best drawing application out there -- at least when I first started to use it (back in 1997). Sadly, its best days are waayyy behind it. This application started out as shareware, reasonably priced, with free support and a 30 day trial period. No more. Now the cost is way up, the trial period is 7 days and real support is a ""Premium"" feature. Smartdraw's market focus has shifted to large corporations seeking a charting wizard for PowerPoint.

Smartdraw's list of lost features speaks to the decline and fall of this application:
-multiple floating libraries
-photo-editor plug-in
-user online space for sharing drawings
-hundreds of free graphics libraries
-support for postscript fonts
-etc. etc. -- you get the picture.

It is user-unfriendly, black-boxish and not for the creative.

I was ""suckered"" into upgrading -- you see, I just got a new computer and needed to re-install Smartdraw.

As an example; the software by SmartDraw allows you to create a room via dimensions, but when those dimensions are not round numbers the software will automatically round up or round down creating the inability to totally decide what your actual space is. Another noticeable fact is that several of the pre-designed shapes such as Cubicles are poorly created. If you break them down into the individual components (un-grouping) they become misaligned requiring several more steps to make them appear correct. Additionally, lining up objects is a difficult task, each object wants to snap to grid, but for whatever reason the grid is different for each object.

When I first started Windows was only a dream and you had your choice of DOS and IBM compatible (both of which were really the same thing in the broadest definition).

Needless to say, things have changed slightly.  You now have Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux with DOS still hanging on for dear life (and  if you're a real techie, try UNIX).

I gave up on Windows when Vista came out and although I like OS X, Apple's stranglehold on computers running their OS has made that proposition a tad expensive.

Enter Linux, the poor man's Windows.  Yes, you can get a thousand different flavors but Ubuntu is probably one of the best (along with Suse) for each of use.

For example:

*  I recently had a computer which had Vista installed.  Something corrupted the OS and the manufacturer was nice enough to send me an install disk when their built in rescue partition failed.  After 4 hours of waiting and answering numerous inane questions I finally had my computer back once I popped in the installation disk.  The only problem was it no longer recognized the video and sound cards nor would it acknowledge the wireless card.  I downloaded the necessary drivers from the manufacturer only to have Vista reject them.  After a few more hours of tweaking and just about losing my religion I finally got things working.  That lasted about two weeks before the OS got funky again and started losing programs such as Quicken and the final straw was when it couldn't find my printer even though it was right there in the printers dialog box.

*  As luck would have it, I have ordered an Ubuntu disk from the manufacturer and had just received it.  From the time I popped it in until the time it was ready took roughly 20 minutes.  Yes, 20 minutes!  It not only recognized my NVIDIA video card and Broadcom wireless card it even downloaded the drivers to make sure both worked.  I then tempted fate and plugged in my Samsung USB laser printer.  Nothing happened, or so I thought.  Upon looking I realized it had found the printer and had already installed it!  Took all of about 5 seconds!

For those of you who are afraid to abandon Windows for Ubuntu you can go two ways -- the live CD or merely tell Ubuntu to partition the disk so you can still keep Windows.  Simple as that!

By the way, you have to option to install a bazillion free programs (actually closer to 5,000), many of which emulate comparable Windows programs.  You'd probably spend closer to $50,000 to get the similar Windows programs.

So, do the math.  You can pay $12 for this DVD (or get it free from the developer) or you can pay $100 to $300 for Windows Vista or $129 or so for Mac OS X (although you'll have to shell out another $1,000 or so for the Apple computer to go along with the latter OS).",Windows  -- Watch Your Back!,1232236800,26,

I have used 9.04 and had many issues resolved. Now that 9.10 is out I think it may be the best OS I have used. And the best part is all Ubuntu OS are free online. There is no copy right violations or stealing in any way. There are numerous sites for support Linus/Ubuntu and if you can't find what you need just post a question and some geek will get back. I use the term ""Geek"" lovingly since these guys and gals really know their stuff, plus I am the proud father of a Geek, and are more than happy to help. Ubuntu itself has frequent updates and support. All the software that you may need or want is free and many of the products that other software vendors sell is free with Ubuntu. Few programmers ask for a donation but even those will run properly without shelling out money. I do believe in supporting those that work properly to encourage them to continue working on new projects.
Anything that a MAC or Windows OS can do, Ubuntu can do also. The difference is price. Ubuntu is free! Plus if you're not afraid to get a little grease on your hands you can get under the hood and see what makes Linus tick. The problem is tearing yourself away from the free games suchas solitaire, suduka, free photo editing programs, cd/dvd programs (please note...I use the plural because there are so many), and Open Office for word processing, spread sheets and other productivity programs.
Now the downside: If you can't borrow a copy from a friend, relative or library it may take a very long time to download. I say borrow because Ubuntu encourages everyone to give copies to friends. The biggest drawback in my opinion is that if are one that can not follow directions and read directions carefully then wait till your kids get home from school.
If you have an older machine this OS and any of the newer ones may not run correctly. My friend teaches grade school and has accumulated about two dozen donated computers, most using 98 or 98SE (Ver i386). All were DOA. After obtaining a copy of Edubuntu (6.06.1) she has resurrected these older machines and even has the USB ports working (which they did not work with MS older Operating Systems. Most of these older machines use the old floppy ""A"" drive and do not have CD readers/writers. For younger kids its great. You give them a computer that is inexpensive, you control what they have access to and you keep them offline so they aren't exposed to what kids should not be exposed to.

- Ubuntu is cleaner, leaner, and more stable than Windows.  Program crashes are less frequent.  When programs do crash, they usually don't affect the rest of the OS.  You won't have junk files and registry errors to worry about, and viruses and adware are simply a non-issue.

- The shear depth of options for both visual style and interface will simply blow your mind.  Right out of the box, Ubuntu has multitudes more customization than Windows has ever offered. Anything from the interface (system tray, task list, menus) can be moved and arranged anywhere.  Install Compiz Fusion and Emerald Theme Manager, and you'll expand your options even more.  You can literally trick out your whole operating system like a car in Need for Speed.

- Many of the popular visual effects and tools from Mac OS X actually originated in Linux.  You can have multiple desktops (Spaces), view all open windows (Expose), and even have a widget layer (Dashboard).  *Some of this requires Compiz Fusion.

- Installation of thousands of free software packages is a breeze using either of the 2 included ""package managers.""  You simply check off all the programs you want to install (and uncheck programs to uninstall), then hit OK and Ubuntu does everything for you.  An array of additional packages are available for download, and can usually be installed easily with a .deb installer.  Popular commercial software such as Skype, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR, Google Picasa, Google Earth, and other great programs are available for Linux too.

- The WINE program allows you to install and run many windows programs.

Having said all these great things, there are a few drawbacks.  There may come times where you do (unfortunately) need to run a specific Windows program that does not work in WINE.  You may want to leave windows installed alongside Ubuntu (dual-boot) so you have the option of falling back to it when absolutely necessary.

I was pretty sure my hardware had gone bad and loaded Linux only as a last gasp attempt to find out what was wrong.  To my surprise, I never had another failure.  Something had become corrupted in my Windows XP software.  I might have been able to recover XP by formatting the disk and redoing Windows from scratch, but the prospect was pretty demoralizing.

Now having said that, I don't want to mislead people into thinking that Linux will run without problems.  It might.  It might not.  How successful you are will depend to a considerable degree on the various devices you have - video card, sound card, WiFi network card, scanner, printer, etc.  Many devices will work out of the box.  Some will work if you go through the effort of finding and installing drivers for them.  Some may even work better than with Windows.  My Linux desktop and XP laptop will talk to each other fine, but my wife's Vista machine has trouble with both of the others.  Mileage varies.

If you switch to Linux from Windows, be prepared to learn some new things.  The OS is not harder to use.  In a great many ways, it presents the very same interface as Windows.  You'll see three little boxes in the upper right corner of each window that work the same as Windows.  You'll be able to use Alt-Tab to switch windows.  Control-C, X, and V will work the same in many applications.  The mouse works the same.  Firefox, Thunderbird, Open Office, and quite a few other applications will look and work the same as they do on Windows and, for most users, are just as good as the corresponding Microsoft software.

But you still must be prepared to learn some new things.  The more you do, the more you'll find that you can do with Linux, including some nice things that aren't in Windows.  If you feel awkward the first week, but are willing to learn a little, you'll be pretty comfortable by the second week and right at home after that.

As others have said, a big advantage of Linux is that it's free.  This isn't just a benefit for initial cost.  It also means you can upgrade your OS, your office suite, your picture viewers and editors, and most other stuff at no cost when the new versions come out.

It also means that you don't see the same quantity of nagware, crippleware, spyware, adware, spambots and viruses that you see on Windows.  And if you ever run into problems, you're free to switch to a newer or a different distribution without paying anyone a fee.

I loaded Ubuntu 8.04 and was happy with it.  When 8.10 came out I upgraded and was happier still.  As of this writing, I'm now on 9.04 and it all keeps getting better.  So far it all runs fine on my now five year old machine.

--- Later ---
I've upgraded to 9.10, then 10.4 64 bit on a new HP with AMD Athlon II with 4 CPUS.  It keeps improving.  I was concerned about whether the 64 bit OS would be safe, but it appears to be fine.  I won't be going back to Windows any time soon.

My main workstation is now on Xubuntu 12.4 and I've been experimenting with 12.10 in a virtual machine.  I switched from standard Ubuntu to Xubuntu when the ""Unity"" desktop environment came out.  Xubuntu with its Xfce desktop seemed to me simpler, less glitzy, more to my taste.  The ability to switch desktops like this seems to me to be an advantage over Windows.  The underlying Linux operating system and pretty much all of the applications are the same for Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce and other desktop environments, but you can choose what style of menus, icons, taskbars, window frames, etc., you want and usually customize them quite a bit too.

Windows still sets the standard for hardware manufacturers.  I was taken aback when my new Nexus 7 tablet used the Microsoft Media Transport protocol (MTP) for communication to a desktop computer and my Linux machine couldn't talk to it.  However I was able to find MTP drivers created by a smart open source programmer, install them, and get back in touch with my tablet.

But in spite of Microsoft's power over the manufacturers, things keep improving in the Linux world.  More and more hardware is supported.  When I bought an HP desktop with Windows 7 I was able shrink the Windows partition and install Ubuntu without a single hitch.  Everything just worked.  I kept about 10% of the disk for Win 7 on the theory that I might someday have to run some software that wouldn't run on Linux, but so far it hasn't happened.  The only times I boot up Win 7 are when I have to reboot Linux anyway and figure I might as well install the latest Microsoft patches while I'm doing it.

I still haven't paid one dime for software since 2008 and yet I prefer my Linux system over the Windows system I use at work, loaded with Windows, Office, Visual Studio, virus checkers, and other commercial programs.

Ubuntu is a Linux operating system.  Ubuntu Linux is not a version of Windows even though it runs on the same kind of computer.  If your computer was a radio, then Windows would be AM and Linux would be FM.  You can use either one, but only one can be the native operating system at a time.  You can listen to news on AM radio and you can listen to news on FM radio but you can't listen to AM stations on FM.  Generally, if your program runs only on Windows, it won't run on Linux.  (If you look too closely at this analogy, it will fall to pieces from all the exceptions.)  But that doesn't mean you can't get work done.

I like Ubuntu because I use it to to edit and layout a monthly newsletter with OpenOffice.org, an 'office' suite.  I use Thunderbird to handle email, including an address book, custom filters & folders, and multiple accounts.  I use Picasa to organize my photo collection.  I use GIMP to create graphics to use on web pages and other places and to edit/touch-up photos.  I play card games and an online tank fighting game.  I listen to mp3s.  I can read/write DVDs and CDs.  I can rip DVDs to .avi files that will play on my pda.  I use Slimserver to stream music to my home audio system, with custom playlists.  I can watch TV shows on the website Hulu.com.

I have entered data for a vast family tree using GRAMPS.  GRAMPS can import and export GEDCOMs and can create a multitude of customized reports about your family tree.

I use Pidgin to keep in touch with friends on AIM, and Firefox lets me use MySpace and Facebook, etc.  I also upload and watch videos on YouTube, read RSS feeds, and create photo books on Shutterfly using the Firefox browser.

I can open, read, and write .doc, .xls, and .ppt files from MS-Office using OpenOffice and share them with colleagues.  I can read and create pdf files, too.

All of the software I've mentioned above either comes free on the Ubuntu disk or you can download and add it for free using Synaptic, the software installer.

Probably the best thing about using Linux is the complete absence of nag-ware.  Your computer programs won't constantly nag you to ""set this application as the default for X type of file"" or to upgrade to the version that actually works.  Linux, and the applications on it, were created by people who use the programs.  They don't like intrusive ads, pop-ups, and nag-ware anymore than you do.  You can't buy software like this.

The system for adding and removing software, called Synaptic, is elegant and easy to use.

Ubuntu is not without flaws.  If you know what hardware you want to use, Google around and find out if it will work with Ubuntu-- sometimes there aren't drivers for certain kinds of hardware.  What that means is that your wifi card or your printer may not play nicely with Ubuntu.  Check first!

I have yet to find a Linux video editor for use by non-experts.  The video editing software I have found generally demands a higher level of familiarity with the technical specifications of digital video than I have come close to achieving.  I have to use a different operating system to make video DVDs of home movies & slides.  That's not to say it's impossible with Linux; it's just impossible for me with Linux.

There is a large and active Ubuntu web forum where I have been happy to find answers to my questions and very little of the geek arrogance that used to be so prevalent on the USENET linux newsgroups.

Ubuntu Linux is a great product, with free upgrades and updates, and an enthusiastic user community that will help you make the most of it.  It is as easy to learn as any new operating system-- if you made the jump from Windows 95 to Windows XP, or you taught yourself how to use XP, then you can use Ubuntu.

Delivery: very fast and reliable as always. The software packaging is fine and the box looks nice and stable.
The publisher: Markt+Technik  concerning such software, this is probably one of the best publishers I know. Its really good value for money.
The software: The program includes also the Soundtrack Recorder. You can install it separately and use it without the video software. The recording of the Soundtrack Recorder can be started in the background  in my opinion really fantastic. It records voices and the music I played was recorded in good quality. (As a microphone, I use a headset from TurtleBeach and my speakers are from Logitech. I cant judge if the quality would be better or worse when using other hardware).
The Soundtrack Recorder offers these settings:
Modus (Stereo, Mono, Auto, Joint)
Bit-Rate (from 96 to 320)
Soundcard you use
Source of your recording
and much more

The VideoDirector itself offers endless possibilities and working with it is fun. Even my husband tried it. Installation was foolproof, the name is shown as Filmora Wondershare. After starting the software, you can choose between the simple mode and the advanced mode.
I prefer the advanced mode because of its diversity. You can even record directly in the program from your web cam, from your screen or directly record an audio track. According to my husband, this is the highlight! He is more interested in gaming but very enthusiastic about this software.
Otherwise, you can insert
videos
pictures
audio files
music
text
colours
and of course much more. But I don't want to write a novel here
You can upload your videos to online platforms directly out of the software, to Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo.
I received the product for a reduced price respectively free of charge for testing. This doesnt influence my opinion on this product by no means.
To put it into a nutshell:

I've had this product for a few months now, almost 6 I believe.  And in that time, I've been satisfied with the editing software.  I decided mid last year to start a YouTube channel and wanted to get a video editing software to help me spruce up my vids.  I had been using Windows MovieMaker but it was so barebones and hard to work with when it came to large files that it wasn't up to snuff.  After searching and researching several different software packages, I decided to purchase this one.

Now, the major factor in me purchasing this software were 2 reasons and they were the following; First, this editing software is actually Filmora Wondershare.  It is known to be a very easy program for beginners to use in order to get acquainted with video editing software.  The second being that the software doesn't require a super high end PC to work.

I'm using a rather old but well taken cared of PC and this video editor works on it.  At the time I purchased the editing software, it functioned on both a 32bit or 64bit version of Windows.  Unfortunately, if you don't have a 64bit version of Windows, this will no longer work because of the recent update that was done to the editor.  Now, even though it does work with older PCs with 64bit versions of Windows, it doesn't mean that it will be a smooth experience.  Not saying that you will have constant crashes or anything, but you will notice a slower performance but that is because of the hardware.  It's not severe but it is noticeable and thus worth mentioning.

When you receive the product it will come in a DVD like package with both the CD and an insert containing the registration information.  Now, if you don't have a way to use the CD on your PC, you can head over to Filmora Wondershare's website and download the editing software with the link they provide and then use the insert to register the product.  I've read some of these reviews where it says that the product is a trial version, now I'm not sure what they got exactly, but from my experience, the initial installed editor is a trial version but when you actually use the registration information that is provided, it removes any watermarks or requests to register the product.  Be aware that to register the software, it requires the PC to be connected to the internet in order to access the site's activation page. If you can't connect to the internet, you have to contact Filmora directly.

Let's get to the actual software review, as I stated earlier, Filmora Wondershare is known to be a very easy to use video editor.  Many other video editors can be a bit complicated and overwhelm the user because it requires a bit of setup before actually using.  The beauty of Wondershare is that when you start the application, it prompts you to choose between various modes but the software still sets everything up for you.  So, if you choose the full mode, it sets everything up so that you can easily import your videos and drop them into the timeline to begin editing.  It has enough options for beginners to make their simple projects into professional looking ones.  You can splice, trim, insert transitions, overlay art that is provided by the software or your imported ones, add music, etc..  It has enough for a novice but more than enough for a beginner to tinker around with.  You can import a variety of different file formats, an exact list can be found on their website, I believe.  One of the great parts of the software is that you have enough options to render your file into several formats, from MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, GIF and many more.  Again, there is enough here for the beginner to the intermediate video editing user.

One thing that really bugged me about the software is this, if you actually use the CD to install the software, it is installing, at least the CD I had, an earlier version of Filmora's video editing software.  That version has several transitions and effects in it that are worthwhile to use, but once you register the product it will force download the newest version.  Well, with this newer version, you actually lose access to some of these older effects.  I contacted Filmora regarding this issue and the reply was not helpful, basically these old effects were removed because supposedly the new editor had trouble using these legacy effects so they removed them and cannot provide you a link to download them again.  Definitely sucked to hear that.

I'm giving this product a 4 star rating simply because it is definitely recommended for someone that isn't familiar with video editing but want to start doing it for their projects or to start a YouTube channel.  For someone that has a ton of experience and has used other editors, that is another story.  Personally, if you like a ton of features this in no way will satisfy you as there simply isn't enough there.  For beginners it's plenty and a great way to learn.  Now, if you have used other editors and want something easier, this is it.  Last, I want to apologize for the long review, but again, I'd rather be as thorough as I can be to better help someone who is deciding to purchase this product.  Have a great day.

Edit: Something that I forgot to add, for those that are wanting to know, yes, Filmora Wondershare can screen record.  It's not the best for my PC because it is older hardware, but I'm sure that people with newer PCs should have a smoother experience.",I've been satisfied with the editing software,1489017600,32,

I purchased a small FPV drone several months ago. It records video on a micro SD card. As I usually start recording when I power up the Drone I end up with a lot of video which I down load to my computer. Most of which is just the Drone flying around and not very interesting. Every now and then I see some interesting video that I would like to share with friends through Facebook. I needed a product that would allow me to edit my video files so I could send only the interesting parts and not the whole files. With Video Director I can edit my Drone Files, add Text and Music, and do other unique Effects then send the edited video to my friends. The product is very easy to use and I was creating a video within minutes of installing it on my computer.

It has all basic features you would expect like
- you can also take various pages of different PDFs and combine them into one new PDF quick&easy.
- you can convert any printable data from whatever source like Browsers, Microsoft Office, Open Office directly into a PDF. Including meta data like links, form fields, comments, table of contents and so on.

But it has a lot more advanced features which make the software clearly sticking out of all the various PDF tools available.

With the PDF Editor you can design your document from scratch or open and edit an existing PDF including all the standard features you're used when working with Microsoft Word (formatting, layout, interactive forms, comments  plus tons of convenient features like a picture editor, adding audio and video comments and a clear structure on all comments from different users when working together on a PDF. That's really powerful using it in our company when various colleagues are working and commenting on the same PDF.
And what's also really great and important using it at my company is the possibilily to include digital signatures and encryption.

Furthermore, you can encode documents and give them a password - step by step, easy to understand even if you never did that before.
A really useful feature is comparing two PDF files: find similar pages or parts of pages in two files and compare the content. You can scroll simultanously and highlight changes.
Last but not least you can create form fields you can fill in directly on the screen.

The software side of the disk is great, in that you can instantly choose the opera you want to go to, along with act and scene within the act.  You can follow the operas in three ways (simultaneously if you want) -- there is a piano score, the libretto, and (very nice) a part of the screen that lists the leitmotifs that are being played. You can readily move through any part of the opera with a scroll bar, and there are lots of hyperlinks that take you to musical examples and some (almost a 100) very nice short essays on the Ring and its characters.

You then have the option of clicking at the ""More"" link to stop the music and go to the full analysis. Then one click at ""return to music"", you are back to exactly where you were.

On the ""musicological"" side, this is most complete and sophisticated guide to Wagner's tetralogy known to me. The author apparently has studied and loved the Ring dearly. For most part, the traditional terminology and conventions are used. Only occasionally, an alternative term is proposed and explanation given to justify the deviation from the ""norm"". An example is the ""love-curse"" motif in place of the usual ""renunciation"" motif.

Technologically, this piece of software is a marvel of coding and design! It is small and nimble, and works flawlessly on any PC. During my many years of use, I have never encountered any problem with the software. Not even once has the software ever crashed on me. Furthermore, you can save the entire disc on your hardisk and (in case of a notebook computer) take it with you wherever you go.

In conclusion: This is a most amazing guide to Wagner's tetralogy and it belongs to any Wagnerite's collection. My hat off to the author/creator Monte Stone!

Highest recommendation.

I only just recently learned that this wonderful learning tool existed even though its been out for over ten years!  And thank Wotan I did! This CD-ROM has really opened my eyes to many details and references I had overlooked or never noticed in the Ring..It's thrilling to listen again to the cycle with this software and I would recommend using it after you've listened to the opera by itself without any reference materials or interruptions to distract.  Once you've absorbed it on its own, then go nuts with this program! You get the full libretto and the score which scroll with the performance as well as having each leitmotif marked when it appears and linked to an essay for further analysis! I loved being able to isolate and listen to a leitmotif, read further about it, and hear examples of it elsewhere in the cycle...all at a click of the mouse! AND you get the complete legendary Solti Ring recording in full (though mono, it still sounds great)! Being an owner and big fan of that Solti recording, this was an immediate buy and it is a welcome addition to my other Ring related books, dvds, documentaries, recordings, etc.
Tech-wise for anyone with a MAC..this is a PC CD-ROM, so you would need a newer intel MAC with Windows software either installed or running through an emulator.  I run Windows XP through a Parallels emulator on my Leopard OS Macbook Pro to play it and it plays beautifully!

I teach the Ring to beginners and advanced opera lovers from time to time and use this to pull down the lietmotifs and learn more about The Ring. Every time I use it I learn something new. It is indeed a course on The Ring in its finest form. I recommend it to anyone who wants to delve deeper in Wagner's Ring to find out what all the fuss is about. A real treasure!

OCTOBER 2015 UPDATE: I have had the Ring Disc since it came out in 1997 and it has been running perfectly ever since. I play it on the Windows 7 side of an MacBook Pro without a problem. My newest MacBook Pro no longer includes a CD drive, and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take the Ring Disc with me wherever I go as I have been.

By the time she was four and a half, she was playing it on her own.  Now she's six and still plays it with her younger sister.

An adventure game for kids, with puzzles to solve (that aren't THAT difficult for the tykes) and new places to explore this game is fun for funs sake (there are things to learn, but having fun and figuring out puzzles is the heart of this game). I'm not saying that I don't like the games where you send a character into one room for one kind of activity and another room for another activity (Like Madelines Thinking Games).  There's a need for those too, but I think that fun adventure games with less 'structure' are also needed, and European Adventures is a great one.

The interface is well designed, the software doesn't glitch out this game is reliable. I don't know what it is with lapware and educational games, but I seem to often have problems with them, despite having a system more powerful than what's needed.  On our old Win95 right through to our current WinME machine (with a Win98 in between) we haven't had any problems with this game (except when the CD was scratched, but we had backed it up).

My only complaint is that there isn't another game like it.  The other Madeline software isn't as 'free-flowing'.  I wish they'd put out a ""Madeline's Christmas in Texas Adventure"" or something.  In the interim, I can see the older daughter getting a little bored of this game, but the younger one is doing quite well with it.

The Bunny Game.
It's a nice day out, wouldn't you rather come outside with me and play
The Bunny Game!
Let's go to the park instead, sweety.
The BUNNY  GAAAAAME!
This is my major complaint of the game.  The scene above is  not an every day battle or anything, and my be a result of my daughter's  personality rather than any addictive qualitys of the game.  However, when  she has decided to play it, well, I had better sit down with her to  play.
My daughter, who just turned 2, sees Mommy and Daddy cook, so she  likes to cook.  She sees  Mommy and Daddy clean up the kitchen, so she  likes to clean up the kitchen.  She sees Mommy and Daddy use the  computer....  so, having a game that lets her use the computer, I think, is  mostly a good thing.
I think we got the game for her right around when  she was the recommended 18 months old or so, and when we first started to  play it with her we had to help her with most of the activities.  I am not  sure that she even really understood that she was controling the action.  It was, I think, lots of pretty pictures and songs.  The game is set up so  that your budding computer expert doesn't have to click the mouse to make  things happen; a child only has to move the mouse to play any of the games.  Still, some of the games are harder than others.  Some of the games will  reward your toddler with a song for just ramdomly moving the mouse, while  others will require a good deal of concentration, which is an asset of the  game.  Your 18m-3year old will be able to play the games.  The hardest  skill to master, and what casues the most frustration (for the toddler) is  the screen where they choose which game to play.
Notice that I said that  When we sit down to play the game.  As I already said, your 18Month old  will require help, and as you continue to help your child, they may come to  expect it, and suddenly playing this game will become a bonding experience  if you are that kind of parent, or a chore, if you are another kind of  parent, or both if you are somewhere in between.  I don't know if I want to  leave a 2 year old incharge of $2000 worth of hardware, and what ever else  I forgot to back up on the hard drive anyhow.  2 might be a better age to  start them on this game, however, from both a cognative and a motor skills  perspective.  I am not sure that an 18 month understands what is expected  of them by the game.  You might be better off to surf Tele-Tubbie Websites  with them if they want to use the computer with Daddy.",The BUNNY GAAAAAME!,943833600,51,

 I put the cd in the computer with eager eyes waiting and after filling out the forms to register we then were given the option to name a Horse. We chose the names from Black Beauty, a review to follow soon.

The horses are white, black and brown to choose from. They are in the stable waiting for the arrival of Barbie. You have the option of grooming your horse before a ride. Which makes lots of sense, horse sense, that is. You can click on carrots and/or apples for your horse to eat. Barbie talks during this and calls the horse by its name. The sounds are realistic too. My son likes the brushing part and does this over and over before we get to the next step.

Next you can put on a saddle and bridle and move (with the mouse) the Horse to outside the stable and opt for a race. Once the race starts it is quite exciting. I learned rather quickly that the horse will sit there when it comes to a lake, river, or tree branch or stump in the way. You must click on the mouse and your horse makes a sound and jumps over it. You really do get the feel for riding on a horse and must direct the horse, like one riding on an actual horse would do.

There are trails that you can take and one that rides right along the ocean and then the rocks are falling as well. There are forks in the road and you are given the choice of continuing on the ride or going back to the stable.

My five year old son has a hard time remembering to click when the horse needs to jump and I will find him sitting there waiting for something to happen. The age recommendation is five and up and it should be noted for those not knowing, my son is autistic and not at the age level mentally.

However, having a Mother who is an asthmatic allergic to horses and not knowing how his brother would react to Horses, we are starting with the CD and learning about Horses from the ground up.

There is a race option where Barbie races with Christie and Teresa and that is not as exciting for my son. I do enjoy that though. There is a section with ribbons, certificates and badges and you can print these out.

It comes with a very thorough User guide that goes into detail about the Horseback Ridiing Missions, a Frog Game, Apple Sorting Game and Vine tangle.

We have a nice horse icon on the computer and every time I sign on my son wants to know why the horse picture is there. He knows where the box is kept and when I am in another room, he slips the CD rom in and I find him racing away, usually waiting for a nudge from me at the jump section.",Are you ready to saddle up with Barbie?,1128729600,10,

An example is the computer will buy a bunch of submarines and none of then will appear on the map during the Place Units phase.  The computer will constantly buy more but none of them will appear so the computer just keeps wasting it's money.

However, you can overcome these defects by either playing all the countries yourself or adjusting the game settings.  You can change the cost, attack values, defense, and movement of any unit for any country.  This way you can give the computer a big advantage and make the game much more difficult to win.

Once the patch is installed, the game follows the 2nd and 3rd edition board game rules, and offers a nice range of customizable rule-change options.  The big problem is that the AI is very weak, even on the highest level.  If you play as the Axis, you'll find that Russia is passive, and Germany can storm eastward towards Moscow with very little resistance.  (Now and then there will be a counterattack, but never something so strong that Germany can't reclaim in the next turn what it lost.  And this is especially disappointing because the strategy tutorials emphasize that Russia has to be active and attack one of the three German border territories right in its first turn.  The AI does not follow its own advice.)

At any rate, once Germany seizes Moscow, the game is effectively over.  Russia will do NOTHING once its capital is lost, allowing Germany to bide its time picking off Russian territories one by one, and then mustering its troops to polish off the remaining troops (usually in Karelia) when the coast is clear.  By this point, Germany's economy should be at least 50 IPC's.

If you play as the Allies, you'll find that GERMANY is too passive, and Russia should seize Berlin before too long--again effectively ending the game, since Japan cannot survive alone against the three Allies.  I'm not exaggerating.  A skilled board player will easily wipe out the computer on the highest AI setting.  That means you'll get tired of this game quickly.

One other complaint: The soundtrack is downright embarrassing (unless you enjoy cheesy renditions of God Save the King on a 1980's style synthesizer).  I know this game dates back to 1998, but Civilization had a much better soundtrack five years earlier than that.

And finally: The cinematic sequences are annoying and sometimes cause the game to crash.  Turn them off.  Also, if the Axis wins, the game will play a film sequence showing happy Nazi officials and their Japanese allies smiling to cheering crowds and shaking hands with each other.  I think that's a little offensive.","Nice game, but weak AI",1125532800,4,

2934,4,TRUE,"01 22, 2004",A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00000K4CS,,Alex Diaz-Granados,"One of the best map board-based war games of all time, Milton Bradley's Axis & Allies is an interesting and very exciting World War II strategy game.  In college days of yore, a friend of mine and I bought our first game, with its hundreds of game pieces, dice, rulebook and colorful world map depicting a (very stylized) view of the war situation in the spring of 1942.
 Axis & Allies is -- if you can still find a copy, that is -- a beautiful board game to see and play, but its main drawback is that it's time consuming to set up.  You can't place your forces at random; each of the five major powers (USSR, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan and the U.S.) has a card telling players where they have to place their initial forces...on color coded regions all over the world.  This process alone can take up at least 15 minutes, perhaps more.
Another problem was the duration of game play.  Depending on one's grasp of the basic rules and analytical skills -- and my analytical skills were, back then, pretty rudimentary -- a single turn could take up more than 15 minutes, since each turn is divided into various steps (Weapons Development, Unit Purchase, Combat Moves, Non Combat Moves, and Fund Collection).  Depending on your strategy and tactical realities at any given point, you can skip most of these if you have no viable options -- just don't forget to collect your funds, but in most cases the player who neglects a step can find him- or herself in deep trouble.  That's one reason turns take so long.  (The other is, of course, that you have to physically move the pieces, consult the game card and/or the rule book and roll the dice.  As a result, if your circle of friends doesn't include a very patient war game enthusiast, your board game version of Axis & Allies will end up sitting in a closet gathering dust.
Fortunately, Axis & Allies was popular enough that the now-vanished MicroProse Software (original publishers of Sid Meier's Civilization series, as well as Silent Service II and the F-15 Strike Eagle series) adapted it to the more versatile and easier to manage CD-ROM format in the late 1990s.
While the board game's highly stylized (and simplified) map and its bright color coded spaces remain the same in the computer version, memory constrains forced the MicroProse/Hasbro Interactive/Infogrames programmers to make some compromises.  For instance, infantry units in the board game were made to resemble soldiers of their particular nation-state; British soldiers wore their distinctive WWI-style helmets, while German soldiers wore their coal scuttle ""Fritz"" head gear.  In the PC game the soldiers are generic but color-coded.  However, to make up for this, players' planes change their appearance when Weapons Development attempts result in long-range or jet-powered aircraft.
Otherwise, the basics of the game remain the same.  Players can still build up their forces and launch multiple campaigns.  Combat is still resolved by rolls of the dice, and the results are still determined by each unit's attack/defense points.  (Example, an Infantry unit attacks at a paltry roll of one, but defends at two, reflecting the advantages of being dug in and fortified.)
The beauty of the PC version is that you can play it solo against the PC or in multi-player mode over the Internet or even as a ""hot seat"" game.  Setup is no longer a tedious chore; just place the disc in the drive and you are good to go. You can save the game at any point during a turn, something not easy to do in the board game (unless, of course, you have a dedicated game room and took notes on what transpired during the last turn!)
Axis & Allies'  artificial intelligence player(s) can be adjusted from Easy to Difficult by choosing a particular general and rank (Eisenhower and four stars being the best for the Americans, just to give you an example), so this version is good for novice players as well as veterans of the original board game.  Furthermore, the cinematics used in ""cutscenes"" -- showing, say, a submarine making an attack or a squadron of bombers carrying out a raid -- are, even for a 1996-98 vintage game, impressive.
Because Axis & Allies is an old game by PC game standards, even though I ordered it here on Amland I had to buy it used from a Marketplace seller, so I did not get a handy manual that explains the rules (although the board game rules can be a helpful substitute, the PC version's rules have resolved some nagging issues that plagued board game players) or the various FAQ's about mouse controls and the like.

One of my gripes is the choice of format for the graphics. The vector images are WMF files, the raster images are TIF files and the photographs are JPG. JPG is a good choice for the photographs, but WMF is not as universal as Nova development would like you to believe and TIF files are just not one of my favorite formats.
My other complaint is the supplied image browser, an Extensis product. Each disk has a nice catalog, in the form of a database, and the idea is you can use the browser to see the images you are looking for. The major shortcoming is that if you add images to a folder, there is no way to add this image to the database. I also just could not get used to using it it. I freely admit I did not spend much time with this tool. Instead, I use a shareware image browser, or the browser of my graphics program, to view the images in the folder without the benefit of the supplied database. I am much more at home with these tools.
The good news begins with a thick book containing a B&W thumbnail of each image. They are all cataloged and supply the location of what folder you will find the image in. Some people prefer to look through a book to preview the image and for them this is a major plus: Art Explosion is the only collection I found with this feature. While this may seem a like quaint anachronism to many people, I do find myself sometimes browsing this catalog just to see what's there.
What's there is an incredible collection of clipart, backgrounds, photos, cut out letters, buttons (icons) and fonts. The shear volume is overwhelming. The styles range from retro to early Americana to timeless. While some clips are ready to use as-is, other images beg to be modified, and that's what they're there for. There is even a collection of do-it-your-self parts to assemble your own screen being!
The quality of images ranges from very good to excellent. I was a little disappointed when I closely examined one of the TIF images and found what look like scan artifacts. There are too many images to preview all for this type of defect, but from what I've seen this is the exception as opposed to the rule. I can easily clean these artifacts, but they should not have been there to begin with. I was also surprised to find their definition of High Resolution is 300 DPI. While this is adequate, my personal standard for High Resolution is 600 DPI or better.
As a bonus, there is a collection of several hundred fonts and a photo-editing program. I did not install Kai's Photo Soap as I already have a program I use for that purpose. I will let someone else comment on Photo Soap. I am a fontaholic, so some of the included fonts were duplicates of fonts I already had. Overall the fonts represented a useful collection and there were some fonts I did not have, so these were a welcome addition to my personal selections.
This clipart collection is certainly not the least expensive, but I feel it is worth the price based on the volume of images, quality of the images and the printed catalog of images. I found some duplication of the bonus tools with programs I already own and use, but I have no gripe with their inclusion in the package. I was looking at buying clipart, not more programs. For that, I think this package represents a fair value. If I could rate this frationally, I'd give it a 3.75  It's way better than average, but a little short of outstanding and well short of excellent. You won't go wrong with this package as a starter collection.
3/19/2004
I found two of the images in the collection were corrupt and would not display properly. I contacted NovaSoft via e-mail and had a reply within 24 hrs. They sent me two replacement CDs. When I checked the images om the replacement CD, they too were corrupt. I called tech support and within a matter of minutes, I was e-mailed replacement images in a different format. The images that were bad were WMF clipart. The clips e-mailed were in EPS format. The new EPS images were perfect. According to the tech I spoke with, that's the difference between the Mac and Windows versions: Mac packages use EPS instead of WMF files, and the catalog program is Mac specific.
Add another half point to my rating of this product for excellent tech support. My overall rating is now boosted to 4.25.

Ettins will  steal machinery, and Grendles will steal eggs, and kill Norns. Both can  carry sicknesses. I suggest starting out with the Norn family. Also, the  Grendle and Ettin eggs will not hatch if you place them in the Pirahna  pond. There are two of each egg, and they will come out at different times.  There are three types of Norns. Thwo have two names, one given by  Cyberlife, and the other givin by thenewsreaders in alt.games.creatures .  The names are: Civit/Cow (the reason is quite obvious), Bruin, adn  Bengal/Tiger. My opinion, is that the Tiger Norns are the cutest, and  hardiest.  Some disadvantages are that the appelets are gone. It is  harder to find out if your Norns are sick, inject them with helpful (or not  so helpful, depending on how you play it) chemicals, and to veiw the  chemicals in their bloodstream.  The system requirements say at least  32 megs of RAM, and a 200mhz CPU, but I strongly suggest that you have at  least 250mhz CPU and 64 megs of RAM.

Each norn can  speak to you, using their immense vocab. One, when it's hunger drive goes  up, it'll find what it needs and announces it. ""Alice hungry for  starch."" Norns can say if they hate, dislike, like, or love eachother  and have their own distinct personalities. They take good care of  themselves through trial and error, and can remember things that've  happened to them. Creatures 3 is by far the best yet, at a great price...

Also the environment with the multitude of critters which mate and interact with the creatures and each other adds another dimention to gameplay.
However there are a few elements I found troublesome.  There is an upgrade available in the game for the hand that lets you pick up the creatures, and with the help of another upgrade grendels and ettins.

The user-interface is SO much easier to use!  You don't have to wait for your norn to discover new areas in order to explore the new wolrds.  All you have to do is move your mouse left or right and you can scroll with ease!  It also helps that you can now lead your norns to where you want them to go, instead of having to coax them to follow the hand.  There's also lots to do in the world, like build machines that do things like detect pregnancies and so and, and you can now actually interact with Ettins (they're so neat, and have a lot more personality) and Grendles.  The Norns are also smarter and have a much bigger voacbulary.  The four echo-systems also have many new animals and plants that are fun to interact with, and the graphics are GREAT!  Now for the bad news... Creatures 3 has completely eliminated the ""kits"".  This makes it very difficult to know what's going on with your creature.  You can't ""see throught the creature's eyes"" like you could in Creatures 2, and it's very hard to tell when they're sick, fertile, or what not.  A lot of the new implements in C3 are kind of complicated, and take awhile to master.

The Jungle is swarming with Grendels, who will kill your Norns the SECOND you look away. Ettins roam the ship, searching for teacups. This game is an ENORMOUS improvement upon Creatures 2, which had creatures that were difficult to interact with and teach. Later in the game, you can activate a tool that allows you to breed Ettins and Grendels. There's also an injector, which will allow you to inject them with anything from Life to Cyanide, and a Splicer that allows you to genetically Engineer Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.

I love watching the creatures grow  up then seeing what will change in the next generation :) I'm always checking the monikers to see what's different and the creatures seem to take more interest in their youngsters than they did in creatures 2.",Great game,986860800,4,

So what's this game about? Basically, you are to take care of a bunch of creatures called the Norns. You are to protect them from the virus infected Grendels that may kill them. Apart from that, explore the giant spaceship wth your Norns and help  build machines to protect the Norns.
Firstly, the interface for ""Creatures:3"" has gone for a MAJOR makeover. Gone are the days of having to get the attention of your creatures by waving your ""hand"" infront of it. Now you can simply carry your creature or lead it to the location of your choice instead of having it follow the ""hand"". Even first time users of this game will easily learn how to use the simple and user-friendly interface.
Teaching your Norn words could not be any easier! Just turn on the learning machine and leave it to auto mode to teach your Norn how to speak. No more frustration of teaching your Norn!
Secondly, the graphics for this 2D game is out-of-this-world! Each distinct habitat found in the spaceship has it's own design. The background for each of the habitat looks real cool.
Thirdly, "" Creatures: 3"" has three completely new species of Norns! The cow patterned Civet Norn, the beautiful tiger like Bengal Norn and the plain yet pretty Buin Norn are the new Norns in this game. Better still, these new Norns are much more intelligent that the Norns featured in the previous two games of the ""Creatures"" series-good news to die-hard ""Creatures"" fan.
As each creature in the game has it's own unique digital DNA, each has it's own personality. Since it has it's own DNA, you can ""chemically-engineer"" your Norns to make them stronger or inject all kinds of weird chemicals into them !
The only flaw of this game is that you have to guess the properties of the medicine and chemicals found in the game. The manual included did not explain much about the chemicals.

True they aren't as cute and endearing as the C1 norns, or as graphically clear as the C2 norns, but they have been vastly improved in all other respects.
Saying C3 isn't very good because it's not like Diablo and suchlike is like saying Myst isn't very good because it's not like Tomb Raider, in other words,it's madness! As virtual pets go, these are the most advanced and life-like I've seen yet (and I've seen a few!!)
Truth be told, I don't go a bundle on the creature graphics. The backgrounds are just beautiful, but the norns look rather unclear. If you compare them to C2 norn graphics you'll see what I mean.
The only thing that can be improved is the clumsy interface. The creators, Creature Labs (Mindscape are the publishers) have tried valiantly to incorporate the 'kits' (science kit, health kit etc) in the game more by moving them to a certain area. Unfortunately they just haven't pulled it off. Bring back the kits in the next one CL! I also preferred the graphics from C2, but the personalities of the creatures are just what I like. (The Ettins actually build and steal stuff instead of wandering aimlessly about like in C2. The Grendels search out and kill norns, just like they're supposed to)
This 'game' appeals to many different types of people. The caring and nurturing type enjoy the pet aspect, and the science buffs will appreciate the complex genetics and biochemistry of it.
It's probably a good idea to find out something about it before you rush out and buy it. There are loads of sites out there, even I have one! Things are constantly being developed for download and as it is so expandable, it can stay fresh for ages.

The creatures in C1 were not very advanced, but two Creatures figured out  that they could get the ball faster and play more if they threw the ball to  each other. This shocked the whole online community of Creatures, even the  creators, as this kind of behavior is not expected of the creatures in C1.  In C3, this is a tiny feat compared to what they can do. The programmers  have taken a revolutionary step in not preprogramming the behavior.

Problems with this game:
Poor instruction: the box doesn't even come with instructions, a booklet or pamplet to help you learn how to play the game.  After you install it there is still no direction on what to do, you just have to click and hope you get somewhere. You can not select activities as you have to follow the order they give.  It's mostly a lot of reading and answering boring questions.

KID APPEAL:
The game is rather engaging - its adventure-filled storyline, while slightly weird, appeals a lot to the age range, and the tomboyish protagonist, Jo Hammet, appeals to both males and females. The subtitle that is occasionally attributed to it - ""Jo Hammet, Kid Detective"" - is slightly deceptive; the player doesn't do too much actual sleuthing. ""Jo Hammet, Kid Bomb Squad"" might be more accurate, but your kid won't mind - it's fun either way. Also, some of the activities in this game are very fun and arcade-like. The activities that are not action-packed tend to be more puzzle-oriented, but rather than being frustrating, they are usually pleasurable and fun - not too challenging, not too easy.

A glaring exception to this is the Crossword Puzzle game. It asks some good geography questions, but it also asks questions about art history that are VERY obscure and that no fifth grader should be expected to know. The player can look through an entire museum to find the answers, but unfortunately, it's still quite hard - especially since there's SO much to look through. (One of the artists that you had to answer a question about only painted ONE tiny painting in the entire museum, and it was hidden in an obscure corner!) The crossword puzzle could've been interesting, educational and fun for kids, but sadly, it didn't exactly ""come together"". I agree with the reviewer who suggest Google!

GENERAL EASE OF USE:
This product is relatively easy to use and straightforward, but not as much as other kids' educational games (i.e., it doesn't walk you through every step like other games), but this isn't necessarily all bad. There are a few points that are challenging, however. For example, over and over again in this game, you have to go through a ""dialog"" portion where you select things for Jo to say to various characters. Unfortunately, it's really unintuitive; in order to move on from the dialog portion and progress in the game, you need to say a certain ""trigger"" phrase. The option that's the ""trigger"" seems pretty random, at least in the first couple dialog sessions, but as you move on, it starts making at least a little bit more sense.

Also, one game (which basically consists of solving math problems) is just a tad confusing at first, due to the fact that, rather than typing in the final answer, you have to do it step-by-step - for example, if you're answering 48 + 18, you'd first up the numerals in the ones column, and thus type in 6, and then the program automatically enters the 1 by itself and carries it to the tens column. At first, it's confusing, but once you get used to it, it's actually rather nice and makes it easier. Unfortunately, if you happen to learn how to solve math problems with a different method, it kinda gets difficult and you might need a little help. (This happened with me for multiplication.)

Overall, though, the game is pretty easy to use - there are just a few issues here and there that can be bothersome.

EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
First, I'd like to say that the math in this game is really solid and age-appropriate. You have one game (described in the previous section) that's basically just answering math problems - a little tedious for some kids, but definitely very educational, and personally, I found it enjoyable and challenging. Another game has you using fractional measurements to mix up juice drinks, which is fun, challenging and definitely educational. The last game that involves math has you guiding a tiny android around the inside of a bomb, turning on and off different swtiches that each represent a decimal amount in order to end up at a certain number. All of the math in this game is age appropriate, solid, challenging but not too hard - just overall great, and incorporated well into the games too.

Unfortunately, aside from the math, I find the educational content in this game pretty weak. They try to incorporate a lot of subjects - art, geography, history, parts of speech - but the implementation is kind of messed up. For example, in the section that's supposed to teach history, you have to go through arcade-like levels to find certain objects. Unfortunately, while a window that describes each object pops up when you select it, you don't have to read it or anything - you just need to find the objects, press a checkmark, and you're good to go. No real learning is required.

There are a lot of not-explicitly-educational, puzzle-type games. They won't please parents who want their kids to learn actual school subjects, but I think they're pretty good for building some general thinking skills, which is definitely a good thing. Still, maybe it'd be better if they put in some...I don't know...READING or WRITING perhaps? All they have in the language arts arena is a weak parts-of-speech game that doesn't really teach much at all; all you have to do is figure out what words would best go in the context, and it's really obvious what words belong.

Also, if you want your kid to pay attention to one particular subject, you don't really have an option to do that, from what I can see - you have to play specific games as you progress through the game; you can't really select a particular subject. Maybe I'm wrong and there is a way, but I haven't found it.

OTHER:
I'd also like to mention that this game is very repetitive. There are only about 8 games, and you have to play most of them 6 times each. It's not exactly bursting with variety, but your kid might be willing to persevere to make it through the storyline.

OVERALL:
I'd say this game is pretty fun, and your kid will probably enjoy it. How much they will enjoy it depends. If your kid is the type to persevere through a good story despite a few long or challenging points, and they like this type of plotline, they'll probably find it really fun. If they get frustrated easily, however, they'll probably give up pretty fast.

As for the educational value, the math is really strong and fun, but the other subjects kind of failed due to implementation, and the language arts is especially weak. So if you want a game to help your kid practice math and general puzzle-solving (and using Google!), this will probably be a good game education-wise. But if you want to improve reading or writing, this will be pretty useless for them.

Like I said, my feelings are thoroughly mixed. If you can find it for cheap and your kid likes these kinds of games, you should probably go for it. But if you're looking for an exceptional product, sorry - this isn't it. Another game that is a bit better in the educational value and fun departments is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ClueFinders-5th-Grade-Adventures-Secret-of-the-Living-Volcano/dp/B0000691KF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures: Secret of the Living Volcano</a>.

She has spent a lot of time playing with this game, so I'm glad that we bought it, but of the Jump Start nth grade series, it is by far the weakest. The biggest issue is the art history sections and crossword puzzles, full of painters that I've never heard of and trivia that seems largely irrelevant, over the head of most adults, let alone kids. There's no instructional material before the puzzles that introduces the kids to these painters, either; they're just expected to know it. I can tell that a lot of parents felt the same way, because whenever I googled to find an answer, I found that someone had already posed that exact, obscure question and gotten it answered online.

So maybe that's the point of this game. To teach your 5th grader-to-be about the power of online search. I suppose at that, it would be a success... but only if your child has the ability to access Google while playing, and/or if you the parent are willing to help with those puzzles.

We also had some trouble figuring out how to do the complex math problems, multiplying multiple digit by multiple digit numbers. Only after much trial and error did we finally realize you were intended to do the whole problem on the computer, showing each step and then add them together, rather than just enter the final answer, as you did with every previous level of difficulty.

By now, I think the Freddi Fish 3 is more challenging that Freddi Fish 4, for that game has no concept of Negative values as in Freddi Fish 3.

As similar to Freddi Fish 3, this game challenges the kid with un-expected events, new thinking, and problem solving.

To the game, First you must find sams cape and then you find your way to the attic to face thunder and lightening. Thunder is a very grandmothery figure and lightening is like a dizzy maiden aunt.
You accidently press the red switch and have to find and mend all the weather machines before mother nature arrives. You also have to find the missing pieces of the jigsaw you spilt aand put it back together (there are a number of different jigsaws so you don't know which one you will get)
You have four weather machines to fix and they each have two places to hide, so the game is different each time you play.
Every time you fix a piece of the weather machine, thunder and lightening appear and congratulate you so there is plenty of positive reinforcement and encoragement for children to help others.

Once upon a time when I worked in a nameless chain bookstore, we had a half-dozen computer stations where customers could try out demos of various titles; both kids and adults flocked to the Pajama Sam demo, and the first two installments of the series were our best-selling kids titles by a wide margin.

Sam  is a great role model for kids.  He's polite, energenic, helpful and up to  a challenge.  And everyone in the family loves his sense of humor.

3223,5,FALSE,"12 12, 1999",A2ZRNN0L6XI9AM,B000023VU1,,2Sense,"My 4 year old daughter has had this program for about a month and absolutely loves the Pajama Sam character - a cute, polite, smart and persistent role model.  So, it's quickly become one of her favorites and  she initiates playing it often.
Pajama Sam's educational style is  different than some other children's educational programs.  It's learning  how to solve problems through observation, memory, analysis, mental  mapping, puzzle solving and trial and error.  The scenario is that Pajama  Sam needs to help correct out of control weather patterns in the world and  to do that has to fix the weather machine.  For example, he has to find  parts, figure how to make them viable, and install them.  But, almost  nothing is direct.  For example, he must get in the gate of the control  center, but cannot until he can get past the gatekeeper.  Or, he must find  a way to open the can of solar energy that he has found before he can use  it.  Hmmm, how can he do that?  So, it's 1-step forward, and 2-steps back -  like many real problems.
Some of these challenges are difficult for a 4  year old, so I think it works best with children of that age if a parent  plans on some patient side-by-side time with their child in front of the  screen.  For example, some of the concepts can be unfamiliar to a 4 year  old child, such as what a Wing Nut might be used for in fixing the weather  machine.  But, if you have the time to spend to coach them through these  parts, I think this game is a good complement to other styles of learning.  So, my 5-star rating assumes some guidance for children as young as 4 years  old.  If they will be left completely on their own with it, I think it's  more suitable to an older child.
One last point:  My daughter now  sometimes says, YOUR QUITE WELCOME in response to THANK YOU.  The talking  telephone in the Pajama Sam game replies to him that way (with QUITE) when  he thanks it.

I appreciate that Mr. Norris is trying to be helpful, and his **fix** will work as described, however, it is an extremely bad idea for most people to make edits in the registry, and should not be encouraged as a fix to get around false advertising and a game that should not be sold in its current form. Any mistakes, even a slip of the finger while making the edits, can result in catastrophy (machine may not reboot next time), so it should only be done with extreme care, and by someone who knows what they're doing. My assumption is that most readers of these posts (and, if fact, most purchasers of game software for children) do not fit that category, or do not want to take that risk.

Do not reward companies that sell things to a general market that are unfit for use, and unsupported by the vendor. Do not buy this product, period.

original comments follow:

This game is not compatible with Windows XP unless your children are allowed Administrator accounts on your PC.  The reason for this is that the game was written for Windows 98, and has not been updated since, despite the indications on the box that it works with XP.

Unfortunately, my son was in tears after spending his allowance to buy this game at the school book fair because in our house, kids do not get administrator accounts.  When I called Scholastic to request support, their only workaround is to run the game as an administrator. They admit it was designed for Win98, and that they haven't updated it because they ""haven't had enough complaints from customers to write a version for XP"".  All this despite the labelling which claims it is XP compatible.  You must run as an administrator because the game needs to update the registry (this is an extraordinarily bad program design decision for a children's game) every time it is run.

I am perplexed at the numerous positive reviews of the game here.  Either all of these reviewers are running obsolete versions of the operating system, or their kids are given administrator accounts on XP, which is dangerous and foolish.  Scholastic will not refund your money once the box is open, even though the claim of XP compatibility is false advertising, at Scholastic tech support's own admission.  My recommendation is that no one should buy this game unless they are still running Win98.  No company should be rewarded for relabelling obsolete software and continuing to sell it as if it was current.",This game should have been off the market several years ago,1133568000,7,

Pros: 1. You can enter your name in the beginning of the game to ""register"" and your name becomes incorporated into the clues. 2. In the study, you can create your own riddles which you can then print out. Great for kids who like to create or like poetry. 3. You can stop and save your game along the way - an especially nice feature for kids with short attention spans or parents who want to limit the amount of computer time and don't want to hear the standard, ""let me just finish this board..."". 4. The riddles vary in difficulty.  A young child may need more help than an older one (good family OR independant activity). The butterfly puzzle is especially difficult - as an adult, even *I* had to ask my husband for help on one! 5. Each room varies so much from the others and not all of the puzzles are the same format.  That really keeps kids' attention. 6. The clues appear in text at the bottom of the screen for easy reference.  Also, the clues are ""read aloud"" when you first enter the room.  This feature is great for kids who are learning to read. 7.  There are trick questions all over the place.  Buy the game and see what I mean! (If I gave an example, they wouldn't be trick questions anymore *wink*).
Cons:  I really only have one complaint about this program.  Unfortunately, it is big enough where an otherwise amazing game is bumped down to three stars because of it's one major flaw: Despite what the box says, you won't want to replay this game once you are done; Unless, of course, you let it sit on your shelf for long enough to forget the clues and the locations of the items you have to find.

With hundreds of new toys for your Catz and Bunnyz to play you or you Petz will never get bored! There's even a Publisher tool and a Web Pack to help you build a webpage of these Petz.

The graphics are incredible, the variety of toys is great, but the fact is,  Catz 4 just isn't about owning petz anymore. They should have stoppped with  petz 3. Catz 4 is totally unrealistic. As usual, it took me forever to find  a pet that matched my personality, but with petz 4 all the catz seem the  same. They don't have unique quirks like in the other versions, and now  about all this game has going for it is a lot of eye candy. After a while,  I even went so far as to go back to playing Catz 2. Catz2 is so much better  because instead of breeding pets, you get more caught up in raising them. I  had a calico named Rapsy (don't ask how I thought that name up) and he was  the only catz2 petz I had. That wasn't a bad thing though, because I didn't  get distracted by baby petz and could watch my petz grow into a very  individual adult.

When I imported my tabby, Spooky, into the  game, he changed from a cheerful Catz that came when he was called and  would do tricks (very uncommon for a Catz) to a sulky, mean one.  This  happend with two of my others as well.  I ended up uninstalling it and  re-installing Catz 3. Don't get me wrong; it's still a very well done game.  However, you already have Catz 3, I recommend sticking with it, at least  until the price goes down.  Catz from version 4 work in 3 (I'm not sure  about toyz and clothes), so you won't be left out.

Bugs, bugs, bugs.  This game is full of them.  The food dish bounces around and your catz never get a chance to eat.  Toys permanently disappear from the playscenes.  For example, the cannon ball disappears from the Circus Playscene.  The game may crash every so often and you lose everything you did.
Where did BUNNIES come from?  Hello?  This is Catz 4; bunnies aren't cats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad if you could breed them, but you can't.  Big bummer.  As for talking to your catz, I couldn't get them to understand me properly, so I just forgot about it.
The game is almost like a bug-filled dull Catz 3.  Why bother expanding, then?  They are almost the same, except for new clothes that barely even have complete outfits, new scenes that lose their unique toys in a day, and bunnies that can't even breed.

3292,5,FALSE,"10 20, 2002",AJY3BIGAAV6JA,B000028F31,,Patrick Jay-John ,"I absolutely LOVE this game! I first played it last year and was immediately hooked! The petz in this game are wonderful, perfect for people who have allergies but just as great for people like me who have real cats or other pets. This game is also great for small children who parents feel aren't ready to have a pet yet, but your petz can run away if neglected or abused so I think this game is suitable for ages 7 and up (mature 7 year olds). I know adults who love this game, so it's great for all ages as an alternative or additional pet or pets. Another good quality to this game is that you can download breeds of petz, clothes, playscenes, toys, programs, and sounds from thousands of different sites (make sure any site you download anything from is a secure one) into the Catz 4 program.
Below are the main good points of this game, and below those are the bad ones.
MAIN GOOD POINTS:
*New Voice Acting Feature allows you to teach your petz voice commands with the right equipment.
*The Playscene Editor allows you to create your own playscenes that your petz can romp around in. You can also edit any playscenes you create or download from the internet at anytime.
*You can adopt as many petz as you like, but beware that your petz will run away if neglected or abused.
*You can breed your petz and create long lines of generations.
*If you buy Dogz 4 and already have Cats 4 your dogz and catz can play together.
*The game comes with 10 breeds to choose from, including bunnies,and lots of toys and clothes, as well as several travel scenes and home scenes which your petz can play in. But as I said before, to get more breeds, toys, clothes, playscenes and more you have to download them from sites on the internet.
*You can take pictures of your petz.
*Your petz make life-like sounds and can do lots of fun tricks. *The sound effects in playscenes are life-like as well (like the sounds of the ocean in the Beach scene).
*Your petz can operate things for themselves, like the music box or a roll-up rug from the Toys Closet.
*Petz are usually very good mothers to their young, and may improve in their maternal skills as they have more kittens.
*Petz grow in size as they get older. The life stages are Newborn, Infant, Kitten, and Adult. If a female cat has a kitten, the new kitten will start out very small as a newborn and will stay with it's mother until it is in the Kitten stage. If a pet is adopted, it comes from the adoption center in the Kitten stage.
*You can spay and neuter your petz if you wish to do so.
*Do you really need any more reasons to buy this game?
MAIN BAD POINTS:
*The bunnies that come with the Petz 4 program should be breedable (they're already neutered or spayed when you adopt them).
*The Dogz 4 program should come with the Catz 4 program so you don't have to buy them seperately.
*Petz should be able to have more than one kitten (or puppy, if you have Dogs 4) at a time (litters).
*Other than those, I can't really think of any other main (big) problems in Catz 4.",Read my review and decide whether this game is for you,1035072000,3,

I discovered two cool glitches for this game. Here is the first glitch: First you pick up something. Next you take a picture with the space bar. Then you take another picture with the spacebar. Now you should see the arrow instead of the white hand. That means you can press cancel and let go. The white hand will be holding whatever you picked up. If you click then you will drop whatever you were holding. There are two uses for this glitch. Do this glitch with the milk bottle to feed newborn kittens. You can also put the fish bowl on a ledge so your catz can't get it, then you do this glitch with the fish food to endlessly feed your fish.

It can be fun for a while, as they can be up while you are playing a computer game or doing some spreadsheet work, but the game gets old after a month or less.  In the beginning of the game, you must pick a catz for yourself from the kennel. You can then name it, and it will be yours to keep on your desktop. There are several different backgrounds where your catz can live, and each has its own special features. On the Snow background, you can make and throw snowballs at catz, and on the house background your catz will chase mice that run from hole to hole.
  It can be interesting to see how each pet will react to different toys. You can put all the toys/tools on your shelf at somepoint during the game, and you can always change with other items you may find. They can be catnip, overwhich catz will go crazy, or pillows, which are good for sleeping on.
  You can breed your catz together and make new catz.  That can be fun for a while, but the generations are not always the same as they would be in real life. An added feature is voice recognition, which can be fun if you have a good mic. Another cool feature is that you can import your own play scenes from photographs or other things. This can let your catz play in your own backyard or living room.

Yes, I am aware that this review will be downsized but I am only informing pre-buyers of this waste of space.
  Right now, I will inform you on the developer, Mindscape/Mattel. Mattel has put Mindscape up for sale. How does this affect the game? Lots. It prevents the development of any type of patches or needed materials to make this game better.  I will use the new playscene editor as an example. About 20 minutes into the game, I receive a white box telling me that I should close or debug this program. I do have a degree in program development and I decided to take a look at the bugs in this program.
  I opened up my C++ editor and found many problems. Some occur with the toys or the playscenes. I, of course e-mailed the makers of this program and informed them of the spring-up of problems with their product and that I was not happy with it.
  The main point of the Petz program is to enchant younger children with the wonder of virtual dogz, catz, babyz, etc. The newest version of this virtual petz game has been depressing. It was clearly aimed at the younger audiences as opposed to the older folk. The game comes with 11 breeds (in dogz 4 only) Bulldogs, Chihuahuas, Dalmatians, Mutts, Poodles, Scotties, Sheepdogs, Labradors, Great Danes, Pigs, and Dachshunds. The owner adopts a pet from one of the listed breeds and takes care of the ""animal"" by feeding, playing, and not neglecting it. When these dogz grow to an adult (after 5 launch days) they can bred with other adult dogz.
  That is the basic point of this program. It is equipped with a clothes closet, toy closet, kitchen, family room, backyard, beach, and adoption center. The travel scenes are the ""buzz"" of this product. They include, Arabia, Gypsy Circus, South Seas, Snow Scene, and Wild West. I must inform you that these playscenes take about 4 megabytes of memory. This entire program takes around 223 megabytes. That's a lot for a game about virtual petz.

Activison did a very good job capturing the feel of the Star Trak genre.  The graphics and sound quality are quite good.  However, as a game Hidden Evil falls  woefully short of the mark.  The puzzles are not challenging. The overall  enviroment is very two dimensional despite ustilizing true 3-D for  generating the main characters.  You can't fall off a bridge even if you  try.  But the worst part is the keyboard-only control.  It is extremely  cumbersome and remeniscent of the late 1980's, when PC adventure games were  just crawling out of the ""text-only"" primordeal soup.  In fact,  much of the game's combat difficulty comes from the interface instead of  the opponents.
It's a shame such a good concept was wasted by  apparent  laziness on the part of Activision.",Good Star Trek - Poor Game,946944000,9,
3328,3,FALSE,"01 4, 2000",A243HY69GIAHFI,B0000296ZH,,tropic_of_criticism,"In many ways, ""Hidden Evil"" hits all the right notes in a genre that has had precious little serious attention paid to it.  In its Star  Trek adventure debut, Activision comes close to reviving a disappointing  genre.  The storyline is strong--stronger perhaps than the movie on which  it's based.  The voice characterization is, no pun intended, engaging.  And  the puzzles, while perhaps easy for hard core adventure gamers, are hard  enough to amuse those of us with busy lives.
Where the game fails,  really, is in its graphical quality.  The graphics are hardly better than  designers obviously believed they were doing better work than that early  entrant into the genre, because they keep forcing 'artful' camera angles on  the player, whether she wants them or not.  These constantly-switching  camera angles don't quite make the game unplayable, but they are annoying  enough to waste your time.  Often, you'll lose track of where you are in a  particular room because the cuts from the various camera angles are so  severe, your location is in no way obvious.  In a few rooms the problem is  so acute that you have to move on faith.
Don't worry, though.  The  gamemakers have made it largely impossible for your accidental movements to  get you into trouble.  In one especially laughable scene, it's *impossible*  for you to fall off a rail-less bridge, but entirely easy for you to get  gobbled up by an unseen monster.  This, of course, is a significant problem  in a game which otherwise strives for plausibility.
WIth these  somewhat glaring design faults hanging over the game, the inevitable  Insurrection.  It does wonderfully amplify that plot.  You should also buy  it if you need to keep abreast of the development of the Star Trek genre.  This is an important stepping stone in that process.  And if you're a young  adventure gamer, still uncertain of whether you like adventure games, this  one will help hone your adventure-playing skills while keeping you in a  familiar environment.
But if what you really want is to be immersed in  the Star Trek universe, be surrounded by known characters, and solve  puzzles while galavanting around the galaxy, buy the much superior  ""Starfleet Academy"" on DVD.

I remembered pouring over my father's collection that took up a large part of a bookshelf, but only represented a few years of the magazine's history.  Now here was a more-or-less complete collection (every issue to the end of 1998) that only took up minimal shelf space.
The only bad thing that can be said about this package is that, as noted below, the picture quality is at times annoying. (I recommend viewing it at smaller than 800x600.) Basically, in order to see the photos at their best, the darkness option at the bottom of the screen must be slid all the way to the lightest setting (then it looks excellent), but then to set the text at its most visible, it has to be slid back to the darkest or next to darkest setting (and even then, it can look slightly smudged). Unless you read first, then look at the photos afterwards, you have to keep switching back and forth. Also, when the text is on a non-white background, as for text accompanying diagrams and charts, it is a strain to read.  But even then, it is not difficult to read most of the text, and this is still a worthwhile package.  After all, you get an (almost) complete collection of the wonderful photographs and fun, educational essays that is National Geographic Magazine (note: you do miss out on things you can only get with the hardcopy like special scented features, holograms and 3D effects (buy the hardcopy if you need such gimmicks), and for the map inserts you need to purchase another cd-rom collection).  Even the old ads are a hoot to look at, and the search engine is excellent.  And sure, there are 30 cds to switch between, but imagine trying to track down an article amongst hundreds of magazines filling up a room instead.
When you consider all of the text you get (110 years worth of magazines, many of which are extremely rare), the price is a great value.  Knowing the excellent quality of the magazine, my one fear in laying out the large amount of money necessary for this collection was that say, in 5 years, it would be necessary to buy it again to get those newer issues on cd, but so far I have gotten an update cd that covers the year 1999 and hopefully more will be released.

The game comes with one 'custom unique' baby. You can also choose from an assorted cookie cutter babyz to play with as well.

The amazing thing about the game is the babyz go through different baby phases-including belly crawling, crawling, and eventually walking/talking. (The babyz no longer age or change when they reach the walking/toddler stage.)

You can play with your babyz, feed them, change them, and dress them in a variety of outfits...and in a way that mirrors the sims-  babyz also have needs you to attend to i.e. changing a diaper, nap time, bottle time, and even caring for your babyz when they get sick. Its kind of like petz meets the sims except with more addicting/extremely cute interactive babyz to play with!

(I also highly recommend you check out the online community for this game-- many people make adorable downloadable custom content from toys to clothing that fits in nicely with the game for more fun play).

Feeding time is a bit hard, especially when u have more than one baby! All babyz have different qualities and personalities. For example one of my babyz is very laid back and easy going, while one of my other babyz is fussy and cries a lot. Some babyz will eat anything you feed them and play with any toys you give them, but others won't eat anything exept their bottle and will hardly play with any toys, except maybe one particular toy. You also have to change their diapers, which is gross because it makes squishy noises (lol). The game comes with a microphone so you can talk to your baby. The babyz gradually grow up. They start off crawling on their belly,  then crawl in hands and knees then they stand and soon after that, they are full grown. Full grown babyz can take a few steps. They also learn to talk. The game offers a wide selection of foods, which include carrots, meat, veggies and peas and much more. Plus some babyz fan sites offer ""hexed"" food to download.

""Babyz"" is an adorable computer game that should spark your own  kids' imaginations. The baby which is on the box you purchase will be your  baby, so after installing it, Babyz asks you just what you want to name  your (first) bundle of joy. Pick your name, and roll! Take your baby to the  changing room and pop him/her in the tub while you go through the changing  room. This room has all kinds of features: hairbrushes for those babies  with hair, medicine for the sick ones, thermometers, and lots of clothes.  Get your baby out, scrub it clean with the towel, and then slip on a diaper  of your choice. Beware: You must change diapers once you hear a squishy  noise coming from your baby, for that means it has a very dirty diaper  needing to be changed. Anyway, after it's clothed in such things from a  tiger suit (a must for those adventrous ones!) to a plaid jumper with navy  socks, take it on a stroll in the backyard, where a slide is all ready for  it, meal time, where your baby will eat everything from mashed carrots  (just take the carrot out of the spoon and it will give you a blob that  they will eat) to oatmeal. Put it in the microwave and wow ! Suddenly it's  heated up for your baby. You can take it into the living room where it'll  listen to Bingo or Sonatina, and who knows ? Your baby could start to love  Minuet in G! The possibilities are endless... take your baby to the spooky  attic where you can get seeds and watering cans to plant flowers in the  backyard, or when baby kicks up a tantrum, settle it down for a quick nap.  Once it falls asleep, listen to it via monitors in every room, and go visit  the house yourself. Also, if you have more than one baby, send one to  Gramma's house (don't worry, he/she can come back at any time) while you  and other baby explore.

I never played the game, but watched my little brother play. Here is what I gather:

Game has a top/angle or 1st person view option.

Game is built along a Command and Conquer/Civilization game line only 80% without violence. You have to mine ""energy crystals"" out of rock caves (thus the name) to get your mothership back on its journey-- wherever that was. You are attacked on occasion by ice, rock or lava monsters which the men you control in the game can fight (10% violence) and defeat. Not so bad. Then there are the ""slimy slugs"" which can't be destroyed, only pushed around. Rather frusterating.

The answer is YES. I actually have chosen something that is 11 years old to something that is new. My Netbook came with office 2010 and I was mostly confused on the functions and how to do things. Microsoft office 2000 is very simple and although it doesn't have the ""sleek and shiny"" design like The new offices does, it still serves its purpose.

Microsoft fails in understanding the true purpose of there PC's. Its not about looks, but functions. For example, you can make an apple pie(random example, I know) that looks DELICIOUS and shiny, but what about the main purpose of the apple pie? Does it TASTE like apple pie? No, it tastes like a muffin. So what it the point of making it look nice when it won't even resemble the taste of apple pie at all?

You see, all my life I was and am always fascinated by the old things. Something unique, something nobody has nowadays. I want to experience how kids would watch TV and how they would use their computers. I wanted to know how they worked windows 3.1 and how they would react to Windows 7 Ultimate.

First, Microsoft had to release a patch that made Windows 98 shut down slower because it was issuing the power off command before some hard drives could park. I think this should have been fixed in the alpha stage and is pretty embarrassing.

The next problem is that it needs a driver for EVERYTHING. Windows 98 supports pretty large hard disk sizes without problems in my experience. So the question is why isn't there a decent driver library right out of the box like ANY OTHER version of Windows. This is a big PITA because NOTHING plug and play works -- ever.

Dell released a generic USB stack for NT 4.0 and it works natively with any flash drive on the market with full hot swap-ability.

Games run on Windows 98 but nothing else. Not a lot of web browsers like 98 and not a whole lot of non-MS programs like it either. Almost any period specific game will -- kind of like a power drill that can only spin a desk fan: who cares?

There is no 'sweet platform'. Windows 95 runs like a top on a 486 or a Pentium 1. Windows NT runs like a bandit on a Pentium III. Windows XP runs great on an AMD Sempron, or Pentium M (everything runs like a scalded cat on a Pentium M) and Windows 7 runs perfect on a Pentium D. Windows 98 just didn't get the freaking memo. I have never found a computer that 98 really agreed with -- the crappy ACPI support caused problems on AMD anything and Pentium III and later. Pentium II and before were too slow. Windows 98 is just the odd man out.

The 'upgrade' Windows ME introduces a lot of cool features, but is a buggy mess. The best thing to do is stick with the NT series (4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8) and don't look back at the DOS versions unless you want 95 or 3.11",.......It's Okay. NT is better.,1375401600,2,

  Windows 98SE stopped problems that occurred in Win95 where a program could freeze your system. Even that Win95 later became available in Fat32, the first versions were in Fat16. Win98 started out using Fat32.
  Also, the reason why it is touted as the best gaming system still out there is simple. It takes up less memory and hard drive space to operate.  All later operating systems produced by Microsoft are extremely resource intensive. One last note, all modern viruses are being created for the new operating systems.

I've used Windows 98 since it was introduced, upgrading from Windows 95.  I upgraded to Win98SE when the Second Edition became available.  I Still use Windows 98SE today.

I have used this OS on countless laptops/notebooks, and Desktop and Tower PCs in various makes and models: IBM, Toshiba, Compaq, and even generic self-built systems using a plethora of hardware.

It isn't that I haven't used other Windows systems such as 2000 ME, XP and XP Professional, because I have.  It is my standard practice, that unless I am selling a system to a client that wants a later operating system, I will re-partition the Hard Drives and reformat it and then install Windows 98SE in its place.  It is the most widely acceptable OS that I know of today that runs almost all current software programs on the market today.  I use Windows 98SE to create DVD videos, to run blue tooth networking devices between various computers (also running the WIN98SE platform), and almost 365 days out of every year, the system works flawlessly.  I have also used the WIN98SE network support to create 10/100 wired networks -- although I prefer Blue Tooth's wireless capability.

Again, I simply cannot believe some of the horror stories bantered around here by so-called reviews of Windows 98SE.  While it is still available, I highly recommend that if you are looking for a great, stable operating system for a used or new computer, that you consider the many advantages of Windows 98SE.

3486,2,FALSE,"10 30, 2004",A3C3KRQQV7EWBU,B00002JV62,,K. W.,"I have used most of Microsoft's operating systems released since 1995 (95A, 95B, NT, 98, 98SE, 2000, and XP), and Windows 98SE seems to have the most bugs.  I have installed Win 98SE on about 6 different computers, and have had one or more of the following difficulties on each machine:

1) I was already having problems while installing it.  For example, when the installation was 99% complete (i.e. after almost an hour of hard work!), it gave me a ""Windows protection"" error, which prevented the computer from starting up.  It took me a while to figure out how to get around that.

2) When I installed other programs, I sometimes got error messages at the end of installation, though the programs seemed to run okay afterward.

3) When I run many programs simultaneously, the computer crashes easily.

4) About 4 out of 10 times I shut down the computer, it freezes and I have to turn it off by pressing the power button!

Thus, if your computer can support Win 2000 or XP (i.e. if it's fast enough and the hard drive has enough space), avoid 98SE at all cost!  Not only Win 2000/XP rarely have the above problems, but some of the latest software (e.g. Microsoft Office 2003) requires at least Win 2000 and won't run on 98/98SE.  In addition, if I am not mistaken, only Win 2000 Service Pack 4 or Win XP Service Pack 1 or 2 can natively support hard drives bigger than 137 GB.  Another (minor) inconvenience is that for hard drives between 64 and 137 GB, you need to get a special, free update from Microsoft if you want Windows 98/98SE to recognize the full capacity of the drive.

However, if you must use either Win 98 or 98SE, Win 98SE is the better choice because certain programs are supported only by the former but not the latter, e.g. Acrobat Reader 6 and Windows Media Player 9, and many USB devices I have used are supported by 98SE but not by 98.",too unstable!,1099094400,5,

This is probably the best approach I've encountered for language instruction.  The organization of material is quite clever.  After you learn a set of related words, these words are then used as reference points to help you learn the next set of words.  The process is quite enjoyable and amazingly effective.  You start with the most basic types of words... boy/girl/man/woman, primary colors, shapes, types of clothing, etc., expressed as simple phrases.  You then work up to some full sentences.

I did begin to have cluster problems towards the end of that  partitioning campaign, but any partition table may develop problems over  that time.  Could be due to hardware as well.
As far as  ""on-the-fly"" partitioning goes, look no further.  This seems  perfectly safe for creating new extended partitions without damaging or  losing data but I will never condone this practice.  I've lost data once  (not related to this) and I'll never take another chance again.

Another thing, for arab users, you can not highlight the right arabic text in frontpage 2000 editor i.e if u try to highlight any word the editor will higlight another word!!! which is very annoying thing (you should use the HTML code to manipulate any word!!)

In no time I had a webpage up and running. Maintaining it is easy, too. Setting up the navigation scheme is simple. There are nice art themes included, and they aren't hard to modify, either. So you can get an attractive webpage published very quickly with FrontPage.
It has some quirks. Netscape, forget it. And some of the free webpage hosting sites have trouble with FrontPage's web publishing protocol. This means you have to upload the pages one by one with FTP (file transfer protocol.) And  you may not be able to some of the features of the themes like CSS. This doesn't bother me a lot, as it is really more a problem of the hosting site, not FrontPage.
The package also allows easy use of ActiveX controls, plug-ins, and Java applets, and normal scripting for fancy stuff on graphics-heavy webpages (careful, as these slow down loading time for many visitors. Know your audience.)  If you are going to get heavily into scripts, ActiveX, plug-ins and more, including Flash, better to go into something like Dreamweaver, where you get more control over what goes into the HTML coding.

My general belief is that in a side-by-side comparison with the other 2 design products I have used is that Frontpage loses more than it wins.
Problems:  Be sure to check out the designed pages in a Netscape browser.  Any complicated page will require a refit for both the 4.x and the 6.x browsers.  Javascript?  Major differences also create problems.  Ever gone to a site in Netscape only to have it look wierd?  Probably designed in Frontpage.  Of course, if you want to dismiss the 30% of your customers who still use Netscape, go right ahead.
The interface is not intuitive.  Microsoft did a great job with Excel and Word, making it easy to use for beginners but feature-rich for experienced users.  Count on a long learning curve on this baby, even if you are a skilled designer.

A lot of my professional collegues scoff at the idea that a professional designer uses Dreamweaver.  They say Front Page is not a real program, it's for hack web designers.
What most of these designers are missing is the true point of MS Front Page 2000.  It is designed for the average joe to come in and be able to design and maintain a simple site with out a huge learning curve.  The interface is very familiar to any Microsoft Office user and they don't have to spend a lot of time learning the meaning and locations of new buttons and tools.
My Company AffordableNetSolutions.com has become a great sucess by designing complex web design and graphics and then empowering our customers to use MS Front Page 2000 to edit and maintain their own sites.  It is easy to add/change photos, edit text and create new pages based upon an exising model.  Our customers are thrilled with our service and the fact that they don't have to pay an expensive web designer to make simple changes to their web site.
I beleive that so many web designers who complain that MS Front Page is a loser program are failing to realizing the benefits that this software can provide for the customers.  Sure, from a professional web designer standpoint Dreamweaver is more functional to do layout design and such. But, it's interface is very intimidating to a newbie.  Also, a lot of features of Dreamweaver require you to have some knowledge of programming.

I also wanted to be able to change hosts without updating every link piece by piece.  The problem is, the way I understand it, that it only does this if you are using a web site host that uses FrontPage ""extensions"".  They are not as common as Microsoft would like you to think they are and often cost more.  Another case of Microsoft trying to dominate (and control) yet another aspect of the web.  Even for basic web design, the WYSIWYG feature is very nice and the program is easy to use, but you pay for it. Also, I expected to be able to anchor a picture anywhere on a page but I still don't think that's possible.

That is, if very basic things like ""navigation bars"" and ""banners"" are not part of your vocabulary. It's like taking a foreign language: Although Intermediate Hebrew is much simpler than Advanced Hebrew, it still assumes you know the Hebrew alphabet. So, if you haven't yet tackled basic Web principles, go buy Publisher 2000 first, and use its Wizard. That's the best tutorial.
But if you are ready to move to the next level and want a site that demonstrates more stability and consistency than a site created in Publisher can give you, then you should consider Front Page 2000. You do indeed need a manual, combined with calling Microsoft's tech support line during your initial free support period (ie, once you start working, finish your project, so you can use tech support for the duration).
A noticeable flaw in Microsoft's generally decent interface between its various software packages: You cannot import your Publisher Web site into Front Page. They do need to fix this glitch. Nor can you import Publisher ""themes"" into Front Page, and the themes in the two packages are not at all similar. But do be sure to ask about your discount on Front Page when you buy it (because you owned Publisher).
I would recommend doing your ""intermediate level"" Web site in Front Page using their 'canned' themes, then tinkering with it as you learn more about design. For example, you will want to customize their themes or abandon them completely, creating your own, in order to preserve your individuality. Fix those kind of design issues later. Concentrate first on learning the new material. Then you can start downloading new buttons etc.
Front Page does not handle JPEGs well as thumbnails, nor smaller versions of photographs, even if you do all the edit work you're supposed to. However, the large versions, once someone has clicked on a thumbnail, are quite good and do not lose clarity.
Additionally, the photographic clip art in Microsoft's online clip art gallery (that you can download free) works well, and seems to retain its sharpness.
I like using Front Page and find it is all that a small to mid-size company (or individual) needs. If your Web site needs to accommodate large databases or fast-loading pictures, you may need to upgrade to Dreamweaver or pay a professional Web designer. Till then, stick with Front Page and learn all you can using its tools, till you are ready to go on to the upper level courses.
NB: An advantage that Front Page has over Publisher, is that it comes with its ""FTP"" built in. Good, because you don't need to get one of your own. Bad, because it makes it more difficult to send your Web site to someone else on disk (many elements simply don't work till they are uploaded, so you cannot send it to Aunt Sally to look at on her computer, even if she has Front Page).
And you do need to remind the company hosting your site to enable Front Page extensions. You would think that this would be part of their systems check when you upload, but for some reason, most don't bother till you call them and remind them to do so.",A useful tool,980640000,37,

If you want to make your website interactive then be sure you get a website host that uses the Frontpage Extensions.  A couple of drawbacks of this software are:
1. It crashes a lot under Win 95 (surprise) 2. The web pages do not, by default, save locally automatically.

I think there is a way you can get this stuff elsewhere, I just haven't tried this yet.  However the point is, some of the whiz-bang stuff Frontpage gives you won't work on these sites.

For those who say HTML what?  This is the best  solution I have found so far.  Yes, you can view the HTML and you may even  get to copy and paste some into the program, however, most likely the only  thing you will need to deal with is the Meta Tags, which can be done after  you have created your pages.  If you look in the HTML view you will see the  top portion of each page is basically the same.  This information will help  the search engines find you once you are listed.  I am working on that  next!

The beauty of this program is once you create your Web site, you  can launch it with ease.  You will be flying on the Web in no time.  You  can start with just one page and build more as you need them, or you can  build an entire site, test it out and then launch.  You do need to be  online and have a domain name set up with your provider even before you  start building.  Those are the first two steps.

While working in  this program, there are various ways you can view your site.  There are  three areas which will be open and also three options for viewing each  page.  On the far left you have a vertical column of icons:

Page:  This  view shows the page you are physically working on. Folder:  Helps you view  and organize all of your files and folders. Reports:  Shows the status of  your files. Navigation: Shows a pictorial representation of your site.  Hyperlinks:  Shows page links between pages. Tasks: This is a list of jobs  you create for yourself.

Then you will see three tabs at the base of your  Web page:

Normal: This is the view in which you will create your Web  pages.

HTML:  This shows things like,  and other such HTML.

Preview:  This shows you what the page will sort of  look like.  Don't rely on this, it is better to go to the main preview  option in the browser.

There are a few basic things you should know  before diving into this program. The main choice is going to be whether you  are going to design the pages yourself as I did, or you are going to go  with a template. If I had to do it over again, and had found a template I  liked, that would be the way to go.  This program has them if you want to  use them.  I chose to start with a blank page and build it as I went along.

1.  First create a new Web by clicking File, New, Web.

2.  Create a  page simply by clicking File, New, Page.

3.  NEVER use capital letters  or spaces in your page names.  They should look like this: windows_page_1  That is it!  4.  When you have created one page, copy and paste it to  the new page, erase the  information you don't need and then type in the  information you want on the new page.

5.  Learn how to hyperlink:  Type a  word, highlight it and then go to Insert, Hyperlink, then choose a page on  the list (you must have at least two pages or you will have to link  externally).  This will link the word to a page.  To link a word outside of  the page, type in the Web site name.

6.  You can preview the whole Web  site in the browser.

7.  When working in ""Normal"" view, you  can also choose to reveal the ""tags.""  This will help you to see  hidden items in your pages.  You can then remove extra spaces, etc.

8.  When your site is ready to launch, make sure you view the site in  ""Report"" view. You can use the spell check to search a page or  the entire Web site.

9.  Adding graphics is about as easy as copying  them and pasting them.

10.  Before opening this program, get online.  You can then test the links as you make them.  To do this in normal view  you must hold down Ctrl and then click on the hyperlink using the mouse.  In preview, all you need is the mouse.

11. To make a background I also  opened up a page on my site and pasted a square of color from a picture I  took.  Then I simply right clicked on my mouse, clicked on background and  selected that picture from the list.  The background magically became blue  and I guess it just happened.  You could choose any picture or pattern for  the background you want.  Just keep it consistent and make sure people can  read the type.

I chose to place ""tables"" on each page.  You  simply add a table just like in a Word document and you can make the  borders color or invisible.  This is handy for organizing things on pages  when you don't want a border.  Once you have your tables in place you can  select different background colors, borders, etc.  Play around with this  feature until you get what you are looking for.  This can all be done by  highlighting the table and then right clicking on your mouse to choose  either ""table properties"" or ""cell properties.""  You  can create various effects.

Are you ready yet?  Jump in, don't worry  but do take with you a sense of determination and a very open mind.  Take  seriously every suggestion other Webmasters give you.  I think if I could  get on the Web, create a site and do it all in five months, then you can  too.  Trust me on this!

Which means that you edit the page like it is, no  more HTML tags, just as easy as you typing something.  The system does the  tagging for you, flawlessly!
It also offers a ""Preview"" tab  for easy editing and for those who just have to, it offers a  ""HTML"" tab where you can see and edit the page using raw HTML  codes.
It offers form editing, Java scripting, plug-ins.  It even has a  ""Visual Basic"" editor!  I mean, what more could you possibly  want!
This is a tool to beginners and seasoned HTML'ers.  It is always  fun to mess around with FrontPage.  With ample features (more than any  other WYSIWYG HTML editors [as a matter of fact, of all the HTML editors]).

1. Operates like other Microsoft Office products, so for many of us, there's already an intuitive basis for understanding the program.
**However, it is not intuitive how one is able to reduce the  size of one window within the program (example: your index.html file), and  open another concurrently (example: your style.css file) -- such as in MS  Word.
2. Saves money by allowing users to create an entire Web-site  off-line, by being able to write coding and preview it all before uploading  it to the server.
FrontPage incorporates Internet Explorer (IE) and  Netscape Navigator well so that, in conjuction with the above, previewing  for cross-browser compatibility becomes very easy.
**However, no matter  how much tweaking I've done with FrontPage, the Opera 3.62 browser cannot  become one of the preview options along with IE and Netscape. (Maybe this  is Opera's problem?)
3. Any program that will write the HTML for the user  (WYSIWYG) will always create some havoc, due to redundant and bloated  coding.

The  program has its bugs, but for the price you can use it for intranet  solutions as long as your network is confined to the latest IE version that  FrontPage supports. It is also a good stepping stone into web development;  some you won't have to invest too much time and money to see if you want to  do this as a hobby or a career.. According to one review a customer had  problem with the FTP function. This is not well explained in the textbook.  You have to get some answers on chat pages and ask questions.

I eat, breath and sleep Web design and site management. Since 1994 I have searched high and low for a Web page  editor that would provide the same kind of control and ease-of-use that I  had come to expect from page layout programs like Quark XPress and  PageMaker. I tried them all: PageMill, NetObjects Fusion, AOLPress, and  then FrontPage. While better than what had come before, FrontPage has  always had one overwhelming shortcoming: it is inexorably linked to other  Microsoft software, particularly the IIS Web server and Internet  Explorer.
I am not a Microsoft-hater; I use IE5 everyday and think it to  be a very good browser. And I used FP98 for a number of sites in the past.  However, the many problems raised by other reviewers are legitimate
-  HTML ""Correction"" - All versions of FP give the author access to  the underlying HTML code, but not complete control over it. If there was  only one right way to do something in HTML, that wouldn't be a problem, but  with three or four ways to centre something, how can FP know which one is  correct? An HTML editor should give the user complete control over all  code. Pointing out errors is fine, but correcting them without asking is  not.
- Server-side extensions - While FP offers some cool stuff like a  guestbook, what isn't made clear to the novice user is that you will need  to have FrontPage extensions installed on your hosting server in order for  the gizmos to work. A lot of ISPs don't want to do this, which is  understandable when CGI scripts can accomplish the same functions with less  hassles.
- Bad HTML Code - Like most Web editors that have come before  it, FP2K produces bloated HTML.
- IE-specific JavaScript and DHTML - The  first time I tried to slam out a page in FP2K, this problem bit me.  JavaScript is a problematic thing: different Web browsers interpret it  differently. It is important to use code that will be understood equally  well by IE and Netscape. With FP2K, forget it. Some JavaScript and DHTML  effects are cross-browser, but many are not, and the interface doesn't tell  us which is which.
FrontPage 2000 is not a professional Web designer's  tool. For them, there is Macromedia Dreamweaver, and text editors like  Allaire Homesite and HotMetal. And FP2K isn't a tool for people just  starting out, because they won't know how limiting the software really is  until it is too late. For them, I recommend a good free WYSIWYG editor such  as Netscape Composer or Namo WebEditor, and some books on HTML.

The CD says it will install on the hard drive.  It does; but only the first game.  The other ones need to have the CD in the drive.  This is a real pain.

Before I left negative feedback, the Amazon page suggested to contact you first.  How can you help?

This was their icy cold reply:

Hi,

This is our policy for returning defective software, music or movies.

After selling half a million pieces of software, we realize that not all software is perfect.

However, we have found that 99% of the time, it is not the software, but usually the user or the pc it is being installed on that is the problem.

System Specs Amazon vs Ebay:

Regarding Amazon ONLY, if you have received a product that does not meet the system requirements as stated on Amazon, we have NO control over the specs listed on Amazon and do not issue refunds based on that issue.  Questions regarding specs listed on Amazon need to be resolved before you buy.

Regarding Ebay we list our specs clearly in every ad and therefore will stand behind what we list and an item may be returned based on the specs.

Before returning any item, it is suggested that you:

Check with the producer or manufacturer website for updates or patches for the software you have purchased.

Be sure the system you are installing the software on is the system the software was manufactured for or the system we state in the ad it will run on.

Be sure you are allowing sufficient time for the software to install.  Most items will install rapidly, however, we have seen some software that will appear not to be loading but after several minutes (as long 10 to 15 minutes in some cases) it will install.

Be sure the cd is clean.  As all the product we sell is new, this is usually not a problem, however, sometimes fine dust will settle on a cd and impede the install process.  By simply blowing on it will remove it the dust.

Unfortunately we can NOT replace or refund the following:

Items that were shipped 30 days previous to today's date.

Items we did not originally sell you.  (Some buyers have attempted to return software not purchased from us - unfortunately, we will know if that is the case and no refund or exchange will be issued).

If you believe you have defective software, you may return it with a Letter Of Explanation as to the problem encountered, including your email address and original order number and of course your name and address..

Upon receipt we will test it.

If it loads and plays, there will be no refund or exchange of product.  However, should you want the item returned, we will mail it back to you upon payment of our normal shipping rates.

If it will not load or play and has not been tampered with, we will replace or refund the item and pay the shipping, plus refund the shipping required to send the defective item back to us, up to the rates below:

All jewel case items must be returned by 1st class mail.

All retail box items must be returned by 1st class mail if possible.

You will need to send ALL THE FOLLOWING:

Item purchased with all the original packaging.

A  letter explaining the problem encountered

Your email address

Your original order number

The name and address you wish a replacement to be sent.

Send the item to:

For those who are looking to walk down memory lane, you may be disappointed.  Unlike the old games where you would hunt down minions, & work your way up the ranks to hunting Carmen herself, this is 1 overarching case made up of several mini missions.  I actually like that take on the game.  The interface is completely different now as well.  Rather than questioning witnesses and getting clues of the next step, the game mostly requires the agents to click on hotspots and retrieve scraps of notes that are, well, rather blunt.  Gone are the days of a slow-build to revealing the solution with a broad clue that applies to a region and more specific clues that eventually narrow down the location you need.

Each mini-mission takes approximately 30 minutes and there is apparently no way to save the game until the mission has been completed.  For that matter, even after certain missions have been completed, the game will not save.  It could not be more frustrating to keep replaying the same missions over and over.

In sum, this game appears to be dumbed down quite a bit from many of the other mystery/problem solving games out there.  The key clues needed to solve many of the puzzles are automatically put front and center after the puzzle has been selected so it takes little thought to solve them.  It's also impossible to lose Carmen's trail.  All the player has to do is contact the chief and she just point blank tells you ""Go here.  Do this.""  I think the game would be more challenging (and educational) if the Chief would give hints, perhaps for security purposes.  Maybe for younger players, that direct approach is necessary, but I find it hard to believe that 12 year-olds need to be so directly walked through the story.

And as an Acme agent, it's your mission to snare the peripatetic pilferer and land her in the clink.
But that's no easy job- as Carmen, with a truckload of thirty- nine cohorts is out to steal everything in the world worth treasuring. Her notorious network has fifty nations in its clutches, and only the cleverest and most cunning agents the world has to offer can dare to ever match up their wits with her. Now the fun begins.
Carmen sends out one sidekick and he robs a country of an extremely prized monument, possession or landmark. Your Acme Chief then transports you to the scene of the crime, where the crook has vanished from. To catch onto the trail, you interrogate the local public on what the crook looked like, and where he was probably headed next. The colourful folk of the world answer your questions with indirect answers that act as clues to a certain nation. Also, their descriptions help you put together a picture of Carmen's crony. Thus, grabbing flights from country to nation with the click of a mouse, you hunt down the hot trail of the crook, knocking on the door of the beauty, sights and sounds and cultures of the globe while you're at it. Chat with the Chinese with the Great Wall of China and oriental music flowing in the background. Swoop down from the snows of Iceland to the desert sands of Egypt. All just sitting on your computer chair.
  And finally, a place comes where the crook is roaming around and trying to mingle with the crowd, you look up the physical profile you've gathered, and gotcha! An arrest- and you've cracked the case. After another thirty-eight challenging and entertaining cases that take you across the savannahs, up Mayan pyramids and in front of the Taj Mahal, one is up against the ultimate chalenge- Carmen Sandiego herself. And certain clues from confessions prove she has a deadly secret up her red sleeve...
Packed with GK, facts, foot-tapping music, breathtaking scenery and the people and faces of the Earth, what Carmen Sandiego has to offer is what the world has to offer. Educational and yet a roller- coaster ride of mystery, deduction and adventure, this is on game that you can't miss. What many have spent their lives tring to achieve- you can do it with the tapping of a keyboard in your own home. So yank this of the shelves and get yanked into the infinite horizons within your screen. To discover the wonder that we call Earth. To feel the exhilirating surge of excitement as you toss wold- class thieves behind bars.

I hope the software technogeeks had a good time designing this monster, because neither I nor my grandchildren (ages 8 and 12) had any fun trying to make it go. It is not very interactive: one has to spend a lot of time listening to the characters recite their lines with no ability for the user to click out.

The real killer, though, is that the clues for catching the criminals are so sketchy that we could not follow them.

With it, you will be able to label your CDs in a handicraft kind of way that will largely satisfy.  Especially for the home  hobbyist or giftmaker, it will be surprising how good the finished products  from this system will look.  Throw in the modest pricetag and you've got a  genuine argument for buying this product.
There are difficulties,  however.
First, the preferred kind of CD labels--those included with  the package and made by CD Stomper--have adhesive not entirely harmonious  with the Memorex brand of CD-R's.  Long term, the instruction manual warns  you, the adhesive may become less sticky on the Memorex CD-R's surface.
Second, the software is a memory hog.  You've really gotta empty your  system tray  before you run it.  Unless you have something over 40% of  system resources free, you won't be able to preview  graphical elements.  Worse, you may think that the graphic element is going to print, but then  it doesn't, making you waste labels.  When system resources drop extremely  low, merely attempting to use the ""insert Graphics"" command will  make the software crash.  Repeatedly.  (By contrast Corel Draw had little  difficulty functioning properly in a system resource-poor environment,  despite being a much more fully-functioned editing package.  Clearly, this  is not the world's most robust program.)
Third, the software isn't so  revolutionary that you care to try to re-run it after it crashes.  While it  makes the process of CD labeling more convenient, I'd rather just have a  template to use in concert with more serious--and more stable--graphical  software, like Illustrator or CorelDraw.  Nothing this software does can't  be done ten times better by full-featured graphic editors.
And fourth,  should CDs labelled with this product come into contact with moisture, the  label will be adversely affected.  This isn't exactly the fault of the  good people at Stomp--it's symptomatic of anything printed on an inkjet  printer--but it's worth mentioning that people trying to make more  professional labels would be advised to choose other solutions.
Now,  having said all this, I would still definitely recommend the product for  its intended audience.  Home users  will enjoy this software.  Most people  could probably make attractive labels within 30 minutes of installing the  software.  The  interface *is* intuitive and convenient.  The artwork  included for backgrounds is in many cases actually stunning.

Four CD labels required six label sheets (2 labels per sheet) before they were (marginally) satisfactory.

In 2003, I purchased this software as part of a ""CD STOMPER"" package. Moments after installing it, I was told I needed an upgrade. After spending an unecessary amount of time getting the upgrade via online download, the problems continued. Without getting into detail, the long and short of it was that the product was not functioning as described: Images were being resized without my consent, and printed images were consistently poor in quality even when the source files were 600dpi.

After multiple attempts to contact tech support via the website, an employee finally answered me in one of the online forums. Unfortunately, not only was the help ineffective, but his responses were few and far between. Eventually, anything I posted was ignored. In addition, users with similar issues were also ignored.

I then tried contacting the company via email, and the responses were even slower. I decided to try the website once more, only to find that my IP had been banned from posting. I was furious, and decided to call the company ASAP.

After getting the runaround, I was told QUOTE: ""my comments were not constructive to the tech support forum,"" and that, technically I was ""not a click n design customer."" According to the person on the phone, I had purchased their software as part of a ""CD STOMPER"" package that was put together by Avery. When I told them that I was using an upgrade that Click N' Design had been given to me DIRECTLY BY STOMP via registered online download, the person on the phone claimed that I was ""really not supposed to have that version,"" and that I was ""given that version out of the goodness of their hearts"" (no lie). They then indicated that access to the tech support area of their site was banned, and that I wasn't a customer. I told them that if I was ignored, I'd be forced to contact the local office of the Better Business Bureau, and I hung up.

Shortly thereafter, I forwarded my concerns to the Avery corporation, as well as any corporate contacts for the Stomp, Inc. company who put out Click 'n' Design. Avery in particular was shocked and dismayed at the behavior of Stomp, Inc. After months of back and forth, the company finally decided to issue me a refund for the initial package purchase I made.

In closing, I must say that anyone and everyone should avoid this product and company. Their product was faulty, their tech support was rude and innefective, and their customer relations department was insulting and uneducated.

Don't make the same mistake I did, folks.",Warning to users,1185321600,12,

Reinstein,"Before discovering the reality of the warning expressed in the title of this brief - but I believe important - review, I used several different brands and types of print-and-stick-on disk labeling systems. The CD Stomper Pro is among the best of the six or seven I tried. That is to say, the software it comes with is pretty easy to use and creating attractive labels for your CDs and DVDs is pretty easy - as is the basic application of them using the ""stomper"" itself, a plastic device that holds the sticky label in correct position so it can be placed on the disk with minimal effort.

IF you decide, after reading this review, to continue to either use or consider using this type of disk-labeling system, be aware that each manufacturer has it's own proprietary 'blanks' - that is, the sticky backed paper labels, while all round and standard disk diameter, are plotted out idiosyncratically on each companies templates. So, the ones you need to use with CD Stomper are NOT compatible with ANY other labeling system. This can be important as the prices for the blank sheets vary considerably. Also, some companies produce blank sheets (and the necessary software) that include options of printing labels for CD cases and narrow side-of-case title label blanks. Others do not. So - IF you are going to use these things, shop carefully. Not just for price, but for the accompanying software and labeling options each one provides.

That being said, the MAIN agenda in writing this review is to try to dissuade you from using these sticky labels at all! All of them (there is no one brand exception that I have been able to identify) will throw the balance of the disk off - some by quite a lot. Over time, this will make many of them unreadable on your standard CD and DVD players. Also, the glue itself causes the plastic of the disk to actually decompose. Again, this is not something you would notice right away - but over time, the quality and overall playability of the information, pictures or videos on the disk will become compromised.

Simply put, while the CD Stomper is among the best of what it is - what it is should be avoided.

Alternatives that will NOT damage your disks - either today or into the future, include 1) simply water-based markers, or - for those of you who, like myself, prefer a more professional looking identification of your disk, investing in either an ink jet or thermal printer might be worth your while. (I have a review posted of mine, The Signature Z1 by Primera - a thermal printer that I have been entirely satisfied with.) Additionally, some computers now come with drives and the necessary software to use a system patented as ""LightScribe"" which allows you to print directly onto the disk while it is still in your computer's drive.

In any event - eschew these stick-on labeling systems. You have worked too hard to produce your disks and don't want them ruined by sticking extra weight and chemicals on them.",BEWARE! Stick-on labels can destroy your disks!,1175990400,10,

The game requires no strategy, just exploring, discovering, and a certain amount of thought, depending on your age.  Your goal in the game is to rescue baby animals that have spread to different parts of the zoo.  Of course, you also have to complete a very easy task to get them within reach, such as throw down a rope, lure them, and things such as that.  I think this game would most likely be a favorite of little ones, since most small children are fascinated by animals.  Putt-Putt is a cute character, and in this game, you can paint him different colors!  When I was younger, I used to have quite a bit of fun changing his color.  But my personal favorite feature of the game is that once you buy a camera, you can take pictures of the animals!  I loved playing photographer and taking pictures in each area I went to, then looking at all the pictures I'd taken in Putt-Putt's photo album.  You can also print the pictures, which I've done a few times.  I only wish that you could save, because when I was little, I got far on the game but had to turn it off, erasing all of my work.

Overall, I'd say this is a cute game that little ones will love!  I can't guarentee older ones will, but I know Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo is a very family-based game that I would gladly let my little ones play (if I actually had kids and wasn't one myself).",Cute & Simple,1105315200,2,

Along the way, kind and gentle Putt-Putt and his dog Pep will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play games as they complete the larger tasks.

In Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, the overarching goal is to reuntie baby animals with their parents so that the zoo can open, but along the way he will perform a variety of smaller tasks.

You get a leaflet on installation and oh yes,  there is this thing that gives you sample chapters from three actual books  on Visual Basic 6.0.  They were Microsoft Press products, of course.  The  entire program is via a CD.
It was slow going for me at first, I had to  constantly adjust the various windows from both the tutorial and from the  actual Visual Basic 6.0 compiler to view everything I needed.  I was using  1152 by 864 resolution.  Fortunately after a while, I learned how to size  and place things so that I would need little readjustment later.  You will  spend the first 10% to 20% of the course becomming familiar with the Visual  Basic programming environment before delving into actual code.  It took a  bit of  getting used to.  I had been previously using C++ and QBASIC  compilers for short math/physics related programs (I am getting a  mechanical engineering degree).  At first you will spend most of your time  learning what icon does what and what window is for what.
The tutorial  became easier after I knew what icon to click or what window to open.  There are ""videos"" of programming that you can just watch but  should either mimic step by step or follow making your own variations in  code.
There are tweleve quizzes with about seven questions each.  If you  had done some programming before, you can usually guess most of the answers  after only skimming the text.  I wish the program gave me more objectives,  however (writing my own versions of what I was SUPPOSED to write wasn't  enough).  I completed the course still a bit weary about starting a  project.  I'll have to go back over some parts of the course before  starting something even remotely complicated.
Keep in mind that this  course really only covers the fundamentals.  It ends with the basics of  object-oriented programming.  If you want to learn enough Visual Basic to  be capable of professional work, you'll probably need to buy an  intermediate or advanced level book on VB 6.0.","At $84.99, I wish it had more",965606400,111,

I am about halfway through the tutorial segment and so far, I am pleased.  Although it gets a bit dry at times, once you suffer through it, it does give you very useful information.
It starts off by explaining the environment of Windows and then moves into the program, itself.  It introduces all the tools and windows inside of the program.  It walks you through the entire process of building three programs.  If you show a large desktop (I used 1024x768) and reduce both windows to be shown simultaneously, you can watch the tutorial for what to do, pause it, and then go over to VB6.0 and do it!  What can be more simple than that?  You get to learn by doing.  That's one  thing that scored this program big points with me!  Later on, more advanced  topics (advanced for a beginner, anyway) are introduced.
Also, since you  have all of the tools you need to start programming right away, it is very  useful, indeed.  There are some features in the Professional and Enterprise  editions that are not available in this edition, but I believe there is an  upgrade rebate to move from this version to those.

If you're having trouble filling out a warrant, like the previous reviewer was, request that a Good Guide to show around any state. After he/she gives you the tour or a portion of it, he or she will be able to help you fill out the warrant via the videophone, with one catch. If you request a tour of Florida, Ivan Idea(the ACME Florida Good Guide) won't be able to help you verify your warrant until you leave Florida. The game's manual doesn't mention this.

When it comes to catching Carmen, look at the faxed message that you'll have collected over solving the cases. All the clues are there as to what Carmen's disguise is if you read through it carefully...although I failed to nab her on my first attempt. The previous reviewer's description was quite accurate, missing only a few minor details. You'll get a shot to catch her right after you're a Super Sleuth. If you misidentify her, she busts three of her VILE henchmen from jail and you'll have to wait two or three more cases to arrest her.

Not only do clues get harder as each level increases, the tourists around the crook look more and more similar as the game progress. You're going to guess wrong a few times.

OK, since you insist... This is about as close to perfect as a toy can get.  The robust little ""dashboard"" can be installed on a standard keyboard, by a standard 4 year-old, in ten seconds flat.  Tonka Joe, the walking 'n talking cartoon guide, deserves a special Oscar for helpfulness, clarity, and his cheery, ungrating voice.  That last is very important, because you will be listening to him for hours (and hours :-) on end.
Watch your children's faces closely when they first realize they can actually DRIVE these on-screen earthmovers, SCOOP the on-screen dung, SWING the on-screen wrecking ball...  Be prepared to catch their eyeballs.
Also be prepared for some serious time to yourself.  The game designers got EVERYTHING right on this one.  It is almost impossible for your kid to get lost or confused.  Using the clearly explained mouse commands, they can bail out of one activity and go to another instantly, or they can choose to drive from place to place (the rigs respond to accurate steering input, but they'll get where they're going even if your kid is just spinning the wheel or blowing the horn).  Interspersed with the construction activities are a series of games, some educational, some just fun, and some very funny indeed.  My boy was delighted when he discovered that he could drop the shipping containers in the water, instead of loading them on the waiting barge.  But here too, the designers were way ahead - if a container is loaded onto the wrong-colored cradle, it gets catapulted way out into the ocean, accompanied by Tonka Joe yelling: ""Air freight!""
When I reluctantly turned my old Pentium 200 machine over to my 4 year-old, I couldn't imagine him making any real use of it for a couple of years (other than his usual ""domsdfijkAKm.doc"" creations).  Wrong!  He paints, plays pinball, golf ... but this program is by far the best.
Technical stuff: Installation is a snap.  Every time it starts up, Tonka Joe gives very clear instructions for attaching the dashboard.  The dashboard communicates with the computer by using rods that press the keys - an ingenious way to convert imprecise toddler hand motions into precise computer commands.  However, with enthusiastic play, the dashboard can occasionally get out of alignment - my 4 year-old tells me: ""It's OK, daddy, I relign it myself.""  A Pentium 200 doesn't quite have enough oomph to run the game, but that suits my purposes just fine, because my boy then also gets a lesson in patience, waiting for the occasional hourglass to go away.  Another nice point: unlike most games that take over the whole screen, this one will co-exist happily with other running programs - you don't need to shut everything else down, and you can leave it running while you do other computer work.  A final technical point: in 30+ hours of play so far, it has never glitched or crashed.

I must admit that my Trek-addiction really paid off here, as I found the game to be a pleasure.
For those of you who have played the squad-based Cowboy game Desperados; you will find that Away Team is very similar in progressing through the missions.  Stealth is the better part of valor here and it makes for a very exciting game as you try to flank your enemies, evade detection and coordinate attacks at just the right times.
You play as the captain of the USS Incursion, a Federation vessel that uses holographic imaging to change shape.  As such, the plot of the game is to go behind enemy lines and win covert battles as you try to figure out the ultimate solution behind the plot.  You send down away teams of 4 crewmen (each with thier own special characteristics) on clandestine missions.
On the positive side, I found the all the ""sneaking around"" in the game to be very ""realistic"" (or I should say ""consistent"") with the way that events play themselves out in the Star Trek universe.  Vulcans can do mind-melds, phasers can be set to kill or stun (but they do set off alarms sometimes) and most importantly, you only get a few shots before the Borg ""adapt"".  This makes the game very intense; especially at those times when you evade being detected by a gnat's hair.  Also, the storyline is thoughtful and makes you want to finish each mission to see what happens next.
On the negative side, I do agree with some of the reviewers on at least 2 points.  First, the game is very linear (as opposed to more open-ended squad-based games like Fallout BOS) and you will have to save often as many of the ""appropriate"" ways of winning missions can only be discovered by trial and error.  Second, I agree that the characters are not as well developed as they could have been.

In most of these squad-based games there is at least a little bit of roleplaying.  In this game there is none--character development is non-existent, and given the mission requirements, your picks among the pre-generated characters are often extremely limited.
The gameplay is, likewise, monotonous.  It seems fun for the first few missions but then you realize that it's the same thing over and over again.  After about the tenth mission I was bored out of my skull, and my willpower failed near the 13th mission and I just stopped playing.
Shortly after I gave up in disgust I picked up Fallout Tactics.  If you are considering getting a game in the squad-based tactics genre get that one.

3916,3,FALSE,"06 8, 2001",A2CSXX9RLXZ7TA,B000035Y9O,,Amazon Customer,"Star Trek Away Team, published by Activision, was an interesting premise gone awry.  Personally, I like tactical games where stealth and planning are essential to mission completion.  Heck, I just like building bases, preparing for an all-out assault and then blitzing my enemies as I throwing everything at 'em - which is why I like Blizzard's StarCraft and Activision's Star Trek Armada.
To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of squad-based game play but I am a big Star Trek nut so I thought, this might be cool.  Unfortunately, this game did little to change my original opinion.  Set in the time of The Next Generation, sometime after the Dominion War, Away Team focuses on the exploits of Captain Marcus Reflian, commander of a small experimental starship, the USS Incursion, and his group of highly skilled, individually selected crewmembers and their goal to uncover a nefarious plot that threatens every major power in the quadrant, including the seemingly invincible Borg.  Players must endure a linear progress through 17 missions.  The locales of each mission change, bringing you to Starfleet Academy, aboard Federation starships, Q'onos, and Romulus.  Even though the scenery changes game play does not.  While in single player mode, you command on average, 4 Federation crewmembers you chose for each mission.  Just after the mission briefing you must assemble your away team from the 17 crewmember choices.  Each mission has specific skill requirement that must be met in order to meet the primary objective, such as the need for a medical officer (or someone with medical training) and/or a crewmember that is experienced in using the sniper rifle.  Only after the skill requirements are met can you play the mission.  You must choose your away team from each of the five Starfleet personnel divisions: Command, Engineering, Medical, Security, and Science.  This does not mean you cannot ""double-up"" with your personnel.  You can have two command officers, a science officer, and a security officer, for example, on your away team, if the skill requirements for that mission are met as you assemble your team.  Each character has different skills and inventory items that will enable you to complete your missions.
Game play is reminiscent of chess, as you, with your third person perspective, must maneuver your four man away team, step by step, through your scenario world.  There are tactical elements involved such as using the sniper rifle to take out a sentry from a distance or you can sneak up on an opponent and rendered him dead or unconscious by phaser, hypospray, or even the Vulcan nerve pinch.  However, this brings up two flaws to the game.  Firstly, since subterfuge is vital to most missions, players must maneuver their away team to avoid detection by automated security posts or guards.  This can make missions very long.  In some cases I took over two and a half hours to complete one mission.  Secondly, because you can move team members either one at a time or en masse, managing your team and their reactions can be difficult, as the Artificial Intelligence engine of this game is seemingly limited.  For example, if one or any member of your team is attacked there will be no reaction unless you command that character, so you're sitting cursing at your team member as they let a Borg attempt to assimilate them.  While in other cases you click on a spot where you want your team to walk to - to avoid enemies and they walk right into them, forcing you to start your mission over, as you were supposed to remain undetected for the course of the mission.
Fan's of first person shooters were probably overjoyed when Star Trek: Elite Force came out and might hope that Away Team would bring more of that action to life, but unfortunately it does not.  I hate to sound blasphemous against the Holy Franchise, but save your money for Dominion Wars.

Of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out, each mission's requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway.

COMMENTS:
Students can build math skills as they solve mysteries. There are 15 games at 10 different skill levels, which build more than 25 key math skills, including number computation, fractions and decimals, tables and graphs, and early geometry.  Logic and problem solving skills are used as the student attempts to piece together clues to deduce the answers to the mystery.
ClueFinder's Math includes exceptional graphics and animation and a great storyline. I would not recommended ClueFinder's Math for the struggling student who needs instruction and practice with math skills, but for an average or above-average math student who enjoys fast-switching games and wants to work at quick-thinking and multi-tasking. I also do not feel that the three levels of play cover all basic math concepts for children ages 9-12 and at some levels there are both extremely easy as well as extremely difficult problems. Additionally some students may become frustrated with the speed at which they are required to respond as they solve problems.

It is for one of the other games in the series, and is therefore a better review than Secrets Can Kill deserves.  It may be confusing to see the editorial review for the Tower mystery right under the title for Secrets Can Kill.
I love the Nancy Drew series, and I am a college-educated woman in my thirties.  I have played four out of the first five games in the series (I have not played Stay Tuned for Danger).  The other games have wonderful graphics and storylines.  Talking to the other characters is enjoyable, and the puzzles are challenging enough for an adult when played on the senior detective level.  I played Secrets Can Kill on the Master level (there are three levels for this game instead of two), and I found that my nine-year-old son was not challenged by the puzzles.  Most of the puzzles are easily solved word puzzles that have clues as to the items to gather or hints about the character's secrets.  However, most of the puzzles have nothing to do with the game play itself.  There is one slide puzzle that allows you to find an inventory item; otherwise, the puzzles are just there for hints.  As mentioned in other reviews, this game has cartoon-like characters rather than the 3D-type characters in the other games, and it really does make the game less interesting.  The dialogue is uninteresting and the characters become hostile and barely speak to Nancy through most of the game.  Overall, the game requires only a few answered puzzles to solve the mystery, and the ending is disappointing, to say the least.  I gave this two stars instead of one, which was my first inclination, because I feel that it might be interesting for a child to play, especially if the child has not had very much experience with adventure games for the computer; however, a child would probably still at least want to play on the senior detective level.  I recommend the other Nancy Drew games that I have played to players of any age for a nice, relaxing mystery, and I especially recommend the Haunted Mansion game.

3963,5,FALSE,"11 30, 2001",A14UUF9LHP8YL9,B00003IRBU,,An 11-year old software user,"Well, here we go. Secrets Can Kill is the start of an extraordinary series of Nancy Drew games made by Her Interactive teamed up with Dreamcatcher. This wonderful game has great graphics, a challenging mystery, and difficult yet solvable puzzles. Many people who do not play many PC games will be delightfully surprised.
The game starts out with an introduction of Nancy writing a letter to her father (I find the voices of the characters very intriguing to listen to). Nancy is visiting her Aunt Eloise, but they find out a murder has been committed at Paseo Del Mar High School. Of course, Nancy is asked to solve the case.
The original music and captivating sound effects keep you glued to the computer screen the whole time you're playing the game. This game will really surprise you. You'll be motivated to get every other game in the series after you play this one. Secrets Can Kill is wonderfully challenging, yet easy enough for younger players to solve all the puzzles, figure out what comes next in the game, and then finally crack the mystery.
In my first couple of hours playing the game, I had to explore Aunt Eloise's house, figure out the combination to a safe, solve a flower slider puzzle, and poke through a diner.
What I found intriguing in the game was that there were lots of little clues scattered about, and you really have to be a good detective and search to find them. Most of the items and clues you pick up are meant to help you beat the game, but always be on the look-out for 'hidden' things that help you to come to the conclusion that so-and-so is innocent, or there could be something that you find in a book or laying on the ground that makes one of the suspects seem very suspicious...are they the suspect, or someone else? You never can tell unless you have good sleuthing skills!
Whatever the case, each suspect has some secret to hide, and it's your job to find out these secrets and the real murderer. I recommend this game. You will not waste your money or regret getting the game!",Secrets Can Kill,1007078400,19,

This also may explain why the game is shorter; I'm guessing they realized that the game would be better if it took longer, so the other two games (""Stay Tuned For Danger"" and ""Message In a Haunted Mansion"") have more playing time.  On the other hand, because it is shorter, it's also easier, so this might be better for slightly younger girls than the other two.  Also, this game requires 2 CDs--you have to switch back and forth.

On the hunt for a new Riven-esque game, with a 'solve a mystery while exploring various locales' type theme, I stumbled across the Nancy Drew games from Her Interactive.  I decided to try Secrets Can Kill, the first game, and see what they were like.  I was instantly hooked.  Although designed for younger people, I still found this game challenging and enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the different puzzles that turn up throughout the game, from the standard 'read the words backwards' ones, to the more confusing puzzles requiring you to find different bits of info in several places, and then combine them for a solution. My only gripes with this game are that the cursor is not quite versatile enough - it changes to an upside down arrow when you are both turning around or exiting a building, which was confusing the first few times it happened.  I also didn't like that some of the hallways in the High School were nearly indestinguishable.  I spent a lot of time going back and forth trying to find my way to the library or some other location. Last, the conversations with the students didn't always run the way I would have liked - if you choose to ask the wrong question first, you lost the opportunity to ask a more vital one later in the same conversation.  This can be annoying, and time consuming, as you have to go back and forth to the same person trying to use up all your conversation options. Overall, though, I would highly reccomend this game to any fan of a challenging, fun, exciting computer game.

Windows 2000: Another money making grab by Microsoft?
Some of you, like I have thought in the past, may think that Windows 2000 is just another ""update"" to Microsoft's line of Windows operating  systems. Windows 3.1, then the new face lift of Windows 95, 98 and now  2000. I was advising my clients that not RUSH to Windows 98 if they had 95,  but only rush if they had 3.1. However in the case of Window 2000, I think  every small business person should get Windows 2000 on their computers as  soon as possible.
It can be a costly upgrade, especially if you have to  upgrade (or buy a new computer) your computer hardware (more RAM, larger  hard disk, faster processor) on top of purchasing Windows 2000. I'm not  going to reinvent the wheel and tell you what you can easily read in PC  Computing, PC World, WindowsMag.com, or other sources, but I just want to  summarize the benefits of Windows2000 and explain why you need  it.
BENEFITS OF WINDOWS 2000
Microsoft has worked hard to add a  plethora of new features to Windows 2000. Some cosmetic surface changes and  more substantive internal changes.
There's a slew of new file management  features in Windows 2000, such as new ""open/save"" dialog boxes,  easier ways to open unknown file types and etc.
You can now customize the  Windows toolbars and personalize the menus. For new computer users, just  give them the basics and as they advance add more - or let Windows 2000  move more frequently used menus to the top - AUTOMATICALLY.
According to  the Microsoft Corporate Preview Program Guide, ""In addition to having  been rewritten in simpler language, error and action messages have been  improved throughout to eliminate steps or to provide the user with more  information on how to resolve problems.
The ""Network  Neighborhood"" folder has also been replaced to include a more powerful  ""My Network Places"" folder. Microsoft didn't just edit the  network folder but also improved on the file searching tool.
For the  mobile worker there's a complete inventory of increased mobile  solutions....from better power management, to easier synchronization,  ""offline files and folders"" for work anywhere, anytime, and  anyplace, new network connection wizard, and more.
WHY YOU NEED WINDOWS  2000
Windows 2000 will allow your small business to work more  productively. With less crashing, better interface, and more powerful  installation options (like only install this program when it's used...so  your PC is not full of program pieces that you don't use) Windows 2000 is a  better tool for your small businesses.

I didn't want XP due to their ridiculous licensing, so I did what I should have done 2 years ago: get Windows 2000.
The upgrade over an existing NT installation worked great, but I wouldn't recommend it. Go for a clean installation, which I plan to do soon, but I needed something running now. In a pinch, it will work -- if you already have NTFS installed. Without NTFS, I wouldn't even think about upgrading -- do a clean install (which you can do, by the way, from the upgrade CD without problems). Also, check into upgrading your bios.
Unless you are administering a network of 1000 PCs with NT (and if you are, you know more than I do, so why read this review) and cost is a major factor, there is no reason to stay with NT. At some point, you will need the added features of 2000. The taskbar alone is worthwhile. You have buttons for most used programs that can come up with one click AND you can click back to the desktop without having to minimize all open windows.
I work my PC pretty hard, and I didn't have many crashes with NT. But I had a few and there were occasional hangs with certain programs.

Agony.
The biggest problem with the upgrade was backwards compatibility.  Windows 2000 did not have a driver for any of my peripherals.  It did not install drivers for my printer, my scanner, my video card, my tape drive, my modem or my SCSI controller.  In short, nothing but the computer worked.  I had to use another computer to download a driver for my modem to start the process.  Once I had my modem running, I had to search the web to download and install drivers for each of my peripherals one at a time.
But wait, there's more.  Not only was it not compatible with the hardware, but also with much of the software on which I constantly rely.  This meant that I had to search the web for patches and upgrades for many of my applications.
The upgrade for one computer took two days.  That was about an hour to upgrade Windows and about 10-12 hours of finding and downloading drivers and patches.  The process was shorter for subsequent computers because I already had the downloads.
After having endured this torment, I would have to say that with Windows XP so close at hand, I would recommend that you wait before upgrading.

Some people were anxious about the fact that it doesn't run on older systems. Nowadays the minimum systems sold fit exactly the parameters that Win2000 needs. What I suggest: don't try it unless you have at least a Celeron 333 Mhz with 64 MB RAM (With this configuration it will run perfectly). Why is Win200 so good? It's a robust OS and has many applications that are easy to use and manage and it is user friendly with the Win98 interface. Do I sound like a MS ad? Yes I do but this time the ads were right. Hardware support isn't a problem now as all hardware have their Win2000 drivers, there are only few exceptions (sadly one of these was my modem).
Installation is easy and the installer asks as few questions as possible, installing an ISDN-card or a network card is easy and is done during the installation process. The installation lasts about 30-45 minutes depending on the speed of your system. You can install the upgrade on a computer that doesn't contain an OS, because the installer demands the installation CD of the older OS so you can upgrade your system without tricks (that's what you had to do by Win98, it was tricky to get a new system from the Upgrade CD). Anyway you may keep your old system parameters as well when you are uprgrading. Yet better: when ou're upgrading from Win98 you may keep your programs too, and don't have to reinstall them again. Internet Connection Wizard is the same as in Win98 SE. It's not hard to connect to the internet. Creating a dual-boot system is much easier than in NT and Win98. You may have Linux, Win98 and Win2000 on one hard disk, in this case use the Linux Loader to boot your system, if you have only two Microsoft products on your hard disk, Win2000 recognises them and you may start it with the Win2000 loader.
Win2000 is NT 5.0 so it is a multi-user system with an Administrator and Administrator configured users. You can give some administrative privileges for some users. Win2000 comes with NTFS 5, a new file system that is much better than NTFS 4 used in NT 4.0. Win2000 also supports FAT16 and FAT32. This means that you can drag your files created in the other OS to Win2000 without having any problems. There are many administrative tools in Win2000 and their use is really easy. Help is OK, it contains a lot of information and the processes can be understood by anyone. So you've got the feeling of Win98 but this OS is much better. I haven't had any crashes since I've been using it (9 months). This is a record.
Of course Win2000 has some failures as well. For example it doesn't work well with Office2000, I had many problems with these two.

You should consider that if you plan to play with your machine, Win2000 isn't your choice. It supports many devices and has many drivers for them, but games aren't written for this OS. About 60-70 % of my games just won't run under this OS. This isn't a big problem for me as I use my machine for working purposes and if I want to play, I boot Win98. The best choice is to maintain a dual-boot system where you can choose what to do.

Win2000 manages memory much better then Win95b -- I can run many more simultaneous instances of Visual C (or whatever) in my 192MB of RAM than I could before. Taskmanager is much improved.  Dr. Watson is available to log crash dumps and the faulting asm code when an app bombs.  Language support is better; I can now read Chinese html files using IE directly without having to launch Netscape and a CJK viewer such as MagicWin98.  COM+ is available, etc.  Above all, the new API function calls you've read about in books are available.  The bottom line: if you're a power user, you really should upgrade.
But there are also problems.  My external SCSI RW CD drive wasn't recognized as writeable and wouldn't work until I'd installed the latest version of Adaptec's DirectCD driver.  My UPS can no longer talk to the computer via COM2.  I can no longer configure my AccelStar II card to get OpenGL graphics acceleration.  Chessmaster6000 won't run, and AOL is busted (no internet access).  In view of these problems, and the fact that the reasons for upgrading are overwhelming -- Win2000 is a great OS -- it would be very nice to be able to multiboot.  The rest of this ""review"" describes installation and multibooting issues.
First, to qualify for the [rebate] you must have the NT3.51 or 4.0 CD's (these OSes don't have to be actually installed on your machine, just insert the CD into the drive when prompted).  As proof of purchase, MS will accept the title page of the NT User's Guide in lieu of the barcode strip from the bottom of the original box.  If you're upgrading from Win9x, the OS must be installed -- the Win9x installation CD will not be accepted.
The install program has two phases: booting from the CD with a DOS-like interface, then rebooting and continuing from the hard drive with a Windows interface.  Although the second phase is foolproof, it's possible to go astray during the first phase due to lack of prompting.  In my case, just before upgrading I'd added a new 30 GB Maxtor drive and slaved my old one (holding WinOld = Win95 OSR2) to it; this bumped up the drive letters on the slave drive, making the OS copy there stale (registry paths wrong).  I then copied this to the new C: drive and booted from the Win2000 CD, selecting a clean install.  It found WinOld on drive c: and chugged along, but for some reason didn't reboot properly.  Instead, I got in a circle that repeated the installation.  Instead of rebooting manually as I should have, I continued.  This time, it couldn't find WinOld installed (because it had already been overwritten).  So I inserted my WinOld installation CD, but it wouldn't accept it -- it wanted an NT CD, which fortunately I had.  After inserting that, there was no prompt to replace it with the Win2000 CD, so I ended up spoiling the installation by overwriting some of the Win2000 files with NT ones.  Perceiving my blunder, I inserted a boot floppy and rebooted manually, intending to start over.
But the floppy never regained control-- instead the second phase of the installation took over.  This proceeded uneventfully, but when I rebooted something amazing had happened!  I had a dual-boot system without even having requested one.  The install program had detected WinOld on the slave drive, put the start-up code in the master boot record (shared with Win2000) on drive c:, and then enabled booting WinOld from a slave drive!  I tested it and it works.  If you have two drives and only want to dual boot (you don't care about LINUX or other non-MS OSes), just install your old OS on both the master and slave drives, run the Win2000 install program, doing a clean install on drive c, and you're done.
More commonly, though, you'll have just one drive and want more flexible multibooting.  To be specific, suppose you want to boot LINUX and WinOld in addition to Win2000.  In this case you'll need a good disk partitioning utility such as PartitionMagic (PM) from PowerQuest to create a second primary partition, plus an extended partition for LINUX (each Windows OS requires a primary partition in order to boot, but LINUX does not).  Just make sure the three boot partitions start below the 8GB physical disk boundary, otherwise they won't be bootable.  To install WinOld on the second primary partition, set it active using PM, reboot, and install.  PM allows you to safely resize partitions without losing any data they contain, so you can keep your existing setup intact.  To actually get the bootup OS menu, install BootMagic (bundled with PartitionMagic) in the WinOld directory and reboot.  Note: to work under Win2000 you'll need PartitionMagic5.01 or later, and BootMagic itself must be installed under Win9X or NT3.51/4.0.  This limitation will no doubt disappear with time.
Two warnings.  1) Be wary of System Commander2000 from VCOM.  I tried it before I became aware of PowerQuest's BootMagic feature.  The OS Wizard crashed when trying to analyze my system and I had to cycle the power.  There were also problems with the partitioning, which ultimately forced me to reformat my drive.  System Commander is emphatically not recommended. 2) Unless you have no doubts about the reliability of your electric power company, consider getting a UPS.  Some of the disk restructuring operations can take a long time, and if the power fails while they are in progress you'll be ruined (i.e., have to reformat the drive and start again from scratch).",You really should,971049600,28,

For the IT department, it's pretty hands-off.  The addition  of USB was welcome, and I'm starting to discover the practicality of USB  for small, portable devices like ZIP drives and scanners.  The hibernate  feature is extremely practical since it gets you back to work within  seconds of bootup.
A few strange comments from others that I want to  address.  First, Linux is an excellent OS, but it is not the answer for  every user any more than Win2000 is.  There are more apps for Linux every  day, but many of the apps that you already use are not available there.  If  you are unsure that Windows is the proper platform for you, investigate  Linux (or Mac for that matter).  Also, Windows 2000 is absolutely for  business users.  It works best on a business network, and some of the  features are not appropriate for home use.  For home, Windows98 or ME are  good choices for the person who wants Windows.
Finally, Mr. Small wrote  another review where he shows that he knows not of what he speaks.  No,  Mitchell, Windows File Protection (WFP) is not at all related to Hardware  Abstraction Layer (HAL) in NT.  The NT HAL is the interface between NT and  your hardware.  WFP tries to keep rogue apps from destroying important  files.  This has been a sore point with NT and Windows 9X for quite a long  time.  Some older programs may not work properly with Windows 2000 and may  need upgrades.  This is to be expected, and is intended to protect your  computer from poorly written applications.  In many cases, these  applications could damage Windows NT, causing lockups and other unwanted  behavior.  Windows 2000 tries to prevent this.",A major improvement over NT,967680000,3,

Despite the increased reliace on  Wizards to guide you through the steps, instalation of this OS is  definately not for casual users. If you are a heavy computer game player,  or have no reason to be dissatisfied with Windows 98, stay with  your  current operating system. If you are a real business user, or have a home  network that involves more than a few shared files, go for it, you won't be  dissappointed.
Beware of hardware problems. I've lost the audio drivers  on my Dell system at work. For me this is no big deal as the system is used  in an open office environment where we have sound cards simply because our  systems came with them. We really don't need any audio playback. My home  systems, several brands are represented, are all functioning just  fine.
Some software can also be a problem. I had to switch from Norton  AntiVirus 5.x (NAV 5) to AntiVirus 2000: Microsoft and Symantect both state  NAV 5 will not work with Windows 2000... I didn't believe it, but they were  right! I highly recommend that you run the Windows 2000 Evaluation Tool,  available as a free download from Microsoft, before you attempt any Windows  2000 installation.
One real annoyance is the Windows Protection File  (WPF). This is analogous to the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) found on  NT 4.0  Ostensibly, the WPF is there to protect your operating system from  corruption. It can do the job almost too well. I was unable to use a  bootable Windows 98 disk to perform a flash BIOS upgrade after Windows 2000  was installed. Luckily, this upgrade is not essential to the operation of  my system, I was just wanting to keep it current.

This was before the improved graphics. However, seeing as this was the second game in the Nancy Drew game series, and the first one was kind of a flop, HerInteractive certainly redeemed themselves with this game. This is the game that took play in New York City. Nancy was an extra on the set of a cheesy soap opera. Life-threatening accidents kept occurring on set, and all were aimed at the ego-centric leading male star of the soap opera. Nancy is helping out her friend Mattie Jensen, the female lead, and staying at her house.

While the graphics were not as top notch as they are today, this game had a great storyline, LOTS of suspense, and lots of characters to interact with (there were 7 suspects!). Since then, HerInteractive opted to stay with only 4 suspects per game (with a few exceptions). The puzzles were interesting and challenging, but not ridiculously hard.

The lack of the notebook and checklist make this game sometimes wildly difficult to figure out, but the challenge is welcome by players who enjoy Senior Detective options in later titles.

The plot is by far one of the most detailed and surprising.  I enjoyed the realistic feel to it, since the more supernatural games in the series tend to center upon things popping out at you to get you scared.  The ransom notes were really eerie and great to find.  The fact that so much sabotage was happening in the middle of a TV studio was a really neat premise.

Mattie's Apartment had the least to see in all of the settings and yet there was still plenty of snooping to be done there.  Needless to say, in my opinion, this game has one of the most interactive settings in the series to date.  The dressing rooms and prop room at the studio are chock-full of things to look at, and Dwayne Powers and Lillian Weiss' offices at night have many things to interact with.

The number of suspects in this game is astounding - and up until you get towards the end, it's nearly impossible to pick out who was more likely to have started all the threats.  I was impressed that I couldn't even trust the woman I was staying with in the game!

My only true gripe is that the game is really heavy on linear events - there are certain things you have to do in order, or you're hopelessly stuck for a while waiting for the game to let you move ahead in time.  This one is nearly a miracle to beat without a walkthrough or hints of some kind the first time, but it's definitely one that becomes easier with time to beat over and over again.","Dated, But One of the Best",1311984000,2,
4039,2,FALSE,"05 25, 2011",A3PD6NG6XL336W,B00003IRBV,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},Setsuna,"Stay Tuned for Danger is the follow-up Nancy Drew game to the award-winning Secrets Can Kill. While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.

This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of ""Light of Our Love"" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...

The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.

The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.

Sadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.

The graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).

The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where ""Light of Our Love"" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of ""Light of Our Love"". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive ""suspects"". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.

The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect ""New York City"" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.

While Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!",Stay Tuned for Improvement,1306281600,3,

After getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. ""Stay Tuned for Danger"" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.

Story-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.

Graphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.

Sound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.

Gameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.

Length-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.

All in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay.

1. Windows 98. Windows 98 was easy on the memory-hogging a/v pizazz, but where Windows 98 ultimately fails is in the security department. I expect my OS to be secure. In addition, I expect my OS to be stable. Windows 98 frequently crashes...sometimes for what seems like no reason at all! Windows 98 fails these tests.

2. Windows XP. Windows XP is based on the stable Windows NT architecture, but XP fails with me on several issues. The first issue is too much a/v pizazz in the GUI. I want an OS with a GUI that ""just works"" without any frilly stuff. Number two, Windows XP has been very suspectible to security flaws since its release. And number three, Windows XP is not as stable as Windows 2000 Professional and crashes from time to time. So Windows XP fails these tests.

3. Linux. I mainly use Xandros and Linspire as my choices of Linux distributions. Linux was built to be secure and stable. Xandros and Linspire are both secure and stable, but sometimes their GUIs (the KDE desktop environment) seem memory-hogging. Ubuntu Linux has a GUI called GNOME which isn't as memory-hogging, but GNOME just doesn't feel the same as Windows. I don't consider any of these Linux distributions to fail my test because I use Linux more than any other OS, including Windows 2000 Professional.

4. Windows 2000 Professional. Windows 2000 Professional offers me many security options...even though a good firewall and antivirus tool helps out more, Windows 2000 Professional was BUILT to be secure and stable. Windows 98 crashed like a mofo, and Windows XP likes to crash from time to time. I have yet to have Windows 2000 Professional to crash on me. In addition, Windows 2000 Professional gives me a GUI which doesn't rely on frilly nonsense...the a/v pizazz I mentioned above.

Windows 2000 Professional is an OS that is stable, secure, and ""just works"". Next to the very secure and stable Linux distributions, you can't go wrong with Windows 2000 Professional.","the best version of Windows, bar none",1158969600,8,

A lot of Microsoft staff was there. One quick note is that there were two types of staff. One wore red shirts, and the others wore blue shirts. The whole day seminar/presentation started with an explanation of, ""If you have a technical question, ask one of the Microsoft staff in a red shirt, if you have a sales or marketing question, ask a blue shirt"". I got a charge out of that. Sales people are enamored with what the software can do for you, and the technical staff is enamored in how it can do it.

What I really wanted to share with you is the major difference between W2000 and 98; In W2000 the system files are off bounds by different programs regarding, not being able to modify them for each program. In 98, that doesn't hold true. If a change needs to be made to a system file, then the outside software manufacturer can do it. The only help is that you can run system file checker in 98 to check for modified system files, and correct them.

What W2000 does is amazing. Not only can an outside manufacturer not be able to change system files, if you go in and delete a system file, then exit out of the folder, then go back in, sure enough the system file you just deleted was automatically restored when you exited out of the folder.

Another point I wanted to make; the overwhelming advantage of using W2000 over XP when installing in an older machine is that it is compatible with a lot of the older hardware.

  Here is the problem: You install XP, and up comes a warning that your hardware is not compatible, or needs drivers loaded in order to work. The manufacturers on the other hand, made your older component, whether it is a sound card, or video card, long before XP arrived, so they never created software drivers for it to run in XP. Nor do they want to spend the resources, to create drivers for a product that they stopped manufacturing 6 years ago. You have to check with the individual components to see if drivers are available for XP before buying it, or replace components. The advantage with W2000 is that you are getting the reliability, and the older hardware (within reason) compatibility.

 XP is built on the Windows 2000 platform.

I just built a new machine, so I installed XP Pro on it, and I also picked up a copy of W2000 from an independent seller here at Amazon, and loaded it on my AMD K62-500 for the network. Although I did have one video card that didn't have a W2000 driver, so I changed that very inexpensively with a great 128meg video card on sale with rebates for $29. So my old machines that were built in 1999 run W2000 great. No more programs freeze when several programs are open at the same time. You can leave a machine sitting for a couple of hours and not have it respond poorly when you come back to it, and have to reboot. No more blue screen error reports, having to reboot and run scan disk.

On my new XP machine, I had a bad program loaded, and when would run it, I would get a millisecond error screen, with an instant shut down, then it would reboot without having to run scan disk. I am assuming that since you can't mess with system files, no errors are created. I removed the program, which was a Mickey mouse add on included with a hardware bundle.

For starters the interface is clumsy and does not allow the player to see or interact with critical items unless they are approached from a certain angle. Often the player will find him or herself relying more on repetitive clicking of certain areas, than using the deductive reasoning involved in solving the later games in the series.  At times, the game seems more like a ""whereisit?"" than a ""whodunnit?"".
The game is too linear at times, in that you must do certain things that do not seem crucial to the plot in order to proceed to other events, yet at times the game lets you proceed onto other events unprepared, setting the player up for great dissapointment (tip: do not save the game in the ""bomb scene"" unless you have found the wirecutters).
Perhaps the most dissapointing thing about the game, when compared to the later games in the series, is the lack of realism in both the dialouge and puzzles in the game. There are too many times when the game should include the opportunity to question suspects to get a better grasp on their personalities and does not.  This is not a problem in the later games which usually include thoughtful conversations with the suspects.
Many of the puzzles also make you feel like you are jumping through the programmers' ""hoops"" instead of relying on logic. The final puzzle is particularly worthy of note in this case, as you are given a timed puzzle which can only be solved by trial and error.  At times in the game, you are given seemingly solvable puzzles that do not have impact on the progession of the game (such as word jumbles that state obvious things).  At other times you are misled to believe that you can find important clues by performing certain actions, which lead nowhere.  Realistic solutions to puzzles are also sparse in this game.  For example, at one point, you are required to cut some wires (in a hurry), but are not allowed to pick up a scalpel that is right in front of you.
On a more positive note, the game does have and excellent story line and sometime seemed as though it would redeem itself, but each time it began to flow nicely gameplay was hindered by another problem.

Is it networked? Will I use this for ""business type applications"" or ""personal type applications""? Do I need strong multimedia capabilities?
Windows 2000 Professional is an extremely stable OS. After running it for almost two weeks non-stop, I never had a single problem. Crashes and the infamous ""blue screen of death"" became obsolete things of the past (unless you're using ME). As long as I did what the OS told me, for example not installing unsigned drivers, the OS behaved the way I wanted it to.
Windows 2000 is also an excellent machine for networking, which is simplified by helpful wizards that will guide even a novice through. Because it is so simple to accomplish, this is a favorite OS for laptop users and businesses.
Windows 2000 lacks multimedia capabilities found in Windows ME. Some very simplistic multimedia functions are lost in this OS... If you are finding a gaming system, this is NOT it. Another downfall is that many of the drivers are special for 2000, because it lacks the DOS background in ME. This is very similar to XP. Do not worry about this problem however, because almost all equipment will have 2000 drivers.
Finally, Windows 2000 looks a lot like ME, making it convenient for an individual who is used to the 9x/ME environment to convert over to the 2000 environment, without crossing over the problems of ME.
This is a great OS, however, for the individual desiring the stability and power of this NT based system, as well as the multimedia components of 9x/ME, Windows XP Professional is the way to go...",Power and Stability--Windows 2000,1012953600,9,
4098,5,FALSE,"01 30, 2002",A2II4NKLBUG3TH,B00003JAU7,,Keith L,"The title says it all. This is the best MS OS out there. I am strictly a home user, and use my machine 95% for gaming and 5% for development of graphics/software. Let me get this out in the open right now: 2K Pro runs ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH GAMES. With DirectX 7.0+ you will be able to play 99.5% of the games out there now. Practically anything that ran on 95/98 will run on 2K without a hitch. This OS is very much a home OS as much as it is a work OS.
It may take a bit more hardware than previous versions of windows, but the performance increases are greatly worth it. I am running a 1 GHz PIII with 512M of ram. When I ran 98se, a fresh reboot would result in approx 200 to 225 Megs of RAM being used. On a fresh reboot of Win2K, only 70 - 90 Megs of RAM are utilized. (Your results will vary depending on your system specs). Applications such as Visual Studio 6, Adobe Photoshop 6, 3D Studio Max, Office2K/XP, etc all run faster (especially Photoshop and the Office suites), than they ever did on a 98SE system. 2K blows 95/98SE and even the XP Pro operating systems out of the water performance wise.
I also noted that once I switched from 98SE to 2K, my broadband connection was sped up (around 25 to 50KB/s). I can't really comment on the whole networking of large amounts of computers through a domain with 2K, but I have 4 computers running in my home on a local workgroup through a router, and it was ber easy to get them to talk to one another. Even sharing the printer connected to one of the computers with the other 3 was no sweat. File sharing among the computers is easy to set up as well, as is setting users and permissions. It really isn't as hard as some make it out to be.
Bottom line, Win2K offers all the usability (if you can call it that) and compatibility of Windows 98SE, with the stability of NT4. Keep in mind that a bunch of these reviews that complain about the lack of gaming support, or the presence of bugs were written before DirectX 7.0 and higher was available, and before Service Pack 2 was available. SP2 by the way, fixes 95% of whatever bugs are present in an un-SP'd install of 2K.
It may cost more, but you won't have nearly the headaches you have with 98SE (BSoDs, random crashes for no reason, etc), and you will have the stability of NT4.

-If you have Windows 98 and use your machine specifically for business, GET WINDOWS 2000!  Don't wait for XP.  You will pay a lot for multimedia features that require more memory and processor power.
-If you're into gadgets, music and video games don't bother with Windows 2000.  Windows 9x/Me will play your titles much better than Windows 2000.  You can also wait for Windows XP Home or Professional editions, which Microsoft claims has twice the software compatibility of Windows 2000 and is backward compatible all the way back to DOS.  In addition, you will get the stability of Windows NT with your gaming and office work.  Bear in mind that XP is for computers less than three years old.  Make sure you meet the hardware requirements!
-If your machine is on the older side, (Pentium II 200Mhz or slower) you will not be happy with the XP upgrade.  To play games on these systems, I recommend staying with Windows 95/98.  Windows 2000 will run on these computers provided the system has at least a Pentium 166 and 64MB of RAM.
Think of Windows 2000 as an all business, no nonsense OS.  You get limited multimedia support and a rock solid platform to run your programs.

It is certainly more stable than either of those two versions of Windows, but crashes and ""maintenance reboots"" are still a common problem; particularly with graphics software and games.  DirectX support is buggy and unstable. Rebooting at least once a week is mandatory due to the archaic memory management and flawed garbage handling; which can result in massive system lag if allowed to go too long between reboots.  Networking is still kludgy and poorly designed; and takes too long to set up and debug.  Better than NT 4.0, but not by much.
Hardware recognition is good for commonly used components such as consumer-level video and sound cards; but less than adequate for more specialized hardware, such as CD-RWs and even some types of printers.  Legacy support is almost non-existent.  Win2k Pro is also a serious resource hog.  Expect to have to upgrade quite a lot of your hardware, as you'll need nearly twice the memory and processor power.  The minimum requirement is 64 megs on a P-133 processor.  I'm running a P-166 with 128 megs and i quickly run out of resources.  I'd say the minimum for this OS is 128 megs on a P2-300/K6-2 300; and quite a bit more if you are doing graphics work or need to run more than two or three large applications at a time.  The system requirements indicate 650 Mb of disk space for a typical installation, my experience is closer to 800 Mb, unless you plan to serious limit functionality.
Multimedia, Java, and system tools are rudimentary and buggy; you'll be better off going with third-party software for most of these functions.  Particularly if you are planning to do any software development.  The user interface is improved, but still kludgy in many areas -- bordering on counter-intuitive,  particularly for system administration -- and the Wizards are slow and cumbersome.  Not to mention that Microsoft didn't provide access to some of the most useful tools (through start menu, desktop, or control panel shortcuts), and you'll have to go hunting through the system directory to find them (and you better know what you're looking for since many of the names are seriously non-intuitive).

Windows 2000, built on the NT core, offers great stability and resource management. Everything M$ claims about this OS has mostly been true. Win 2k is robust (great support for Desktops and Laptops in terms of hardware), secure (NTFS file system lets u encrypt your files and password access required to access the system), managable (great for LAN within a single domain, where people can log in and personalize their desktop w/o worries), and stable (once the proper drivers are set, applications run smoothly and if for some reason apps fail, windows will give you an option to close the app w/o affecting overall system).
Perhaps the greatest plus is the OS's Plug N' Play ability, in which NT 4 lacks bigtime. All drivers for Win 2k uses the WDM (Windows 32-bit driver model), which Win98SE could sometimes use as well and provides better resource assignment for hardware. This abstraction gives the hardware open possibility to be both Win 98SE and 2k compatible: expect a much more array of hardware to support win 2k than NT. Note however that drivers designed for 98SE might not work for 2k (but interestingly, 2k drivers will work under 98SE, which I experimented), so 2k specific drivers must be installed.
The only negative thing for this OS is probably its difficult to setup network. Network setup in 2k requires the user to know what they are doing, and small home LAN is MUCH MORE difficult to setup than Win 98. Also, some games might not run under win2k due to its true 32bit nature (although DirectX 7(+? maybe.)is supported), making 2k a less than attractive entertainment platform.
Overall, this OS is great. By the current market trend, users can always expect new hardware support (USB, Firewire, etc.), and as games become more 32-bit oriented, gamers can expect more games to be playable on a stable platform. Give credit to M$ for finally getting it done right- a true 32-bit OS w/ great hardware support and ease of use from a decent GUI.","Finally, a decent OS to come out from Microsoft",971568000,19,

Oh, and I am a home user. I  don't use computers at work at all.
That said, I have a few comments to  make before getting into my own opinions about Win2k. About drivers.  Microsoft has provided so many drivers for so many devices with their other  OSes that people have come to expect this as a matter of course. But, as  anyone (FreeBSD geek included) who has ever set up a non-Microsoft system  can tell you, finding drivers for your computer can be difficult. Microsoft  did an outstanding job in this area with Win2k. They went out of their way  to provide a utility for you to test your system's Win2k compatibility  before you fork out the bucks. Use it. Then carefully plan your  upgrade.
I titled this review ""The Best OS For Home Use"", while  several others warn home users to steer clear of Win2k. Well, in my  experience, Win2k does not crash, ever. I do not have to reboot, ever. That  means I don't have to think much about the software that runs my computer.  Most home users would prefer to never have to do that.
As a consequence I  am forced to actually use my computer to...do something. I run Excel to do  my finances, surf the Web with up to 20 windows open at a time, edit  graphics files in Paint Shop Pro, and write occasional letters in Word. I  do not play games on my computer.
My brother, on the other hand, has  three sons and a wife. They all share the same computer and internet  connection (if AOL can be called the internet) with Win95. His hard drive  is packed with MP3's because his older son spends hours downloading them.  He has no room left for more data files, let alone software. When his  computer starts there are several error messages because of missing  files.
Win2k requires each user to log on with a user name and password.  Each user has a quota of disk space allocated to them. And system files are  protected from curious little users who wonder what would happen if they  delete command.com (cmd.exe in Win2k).
The system is also protected from  users who think it would be cool to load every piece of software known to  Kiddom. Only someone with administrator rights can do that.
For those who  are paranoid about others prying into their files, each user can encrypt  his or her own. And for parents who want to keep their wayward sons and  daughters from getting on the internet while they are still at work,  anyone's user account can be disabled and re-enabled at any time.
None of  these features was included with home use in mind. They are all intended to  keep wayward employees from trashing corporate machines. Yet they are  perfect for home use.

  And now writing this review today, I can say I am  very satisfied with my purchase. After having tried both Linux and Windows  ME I have to say that 2000 seems to be the leader of the pack.
The  install was easy with no glitches at all. On startup the OS detected all of  my hardware except for my Canon BJC-2000 printer.

The  only downside is that not all hardware manufacturers have come out with  drivers for 2000 yet(and in fact some are not even planning to because 2000  is primarily marketed towards small businesses and they won't be using  things like TV tuner cards and video cards etc etc) Still overall a great  OS that will gives you high performance without making the interface too  cryptical.

I have yet to get Windows 98 to be able to see my brand-name, recently purchased 56K  modem, but Windows 2000 saw it with no intervention on my part whatsoever.  I had the same experience with my sound card (cheap, on the motherboard).  The Win2K install was very smooth, including the formatting of my second  partition to NTFS.  The product is friendlier than Windows NT 4 was; it  even allowed me to choose to ""assume"" a ""default"" login  each time so I don't actually have to log into my machine (I'm running  standalone, not on a network).  I had no technical problems during the  install whatsoever.
Here's the weird part.  I thought I'd be clever and  use a 30-day AOL trial as my ISP.  However, I eventually learned that AOL  isn't supported yet on Windows 2000, and here's the problem: the client  software works, you can even connect and browse AOL, but you can't see  anything on the web at all.  I'm pretty sure it has to do with the version  of IE5 that's built into Windows 2000.  AOL acknowledges this on their web  site and states that a special version of the client will be available this  spring.
I did try to install some of the game software that didn't work  under NT before just to see if it would work now (Civilization II, etc.),  and it still doesn't work under Windows 2000, unfortunately.  (I'm glad I  have that Win98 partition!)
Make sure you check the documentation for the  various components in your system--I hadn't realized before I made the  conversion that my HP CD-Writer wasn't supported under NT, period.
So  far, however, I'm really glad I installed Windows 2000; it's already VERY  clear that it's more stable than Windows 98 and it's nice to have the NT  Task Manager (with performance metrics and the whole works) available.  There were some Visual Basic projects I literally couldn't even work on  with Win98 because of memory management issues; the IDE would freeze and  I'd have to kill the process.  The same thing works as smooth as butter  under Win2K.
Overall, it was certainly a more friendly install process  than had I brought an NT 4 CD home.  I recommend this product to  computer-savvy users--especially software developers and power users--who  want something more reliable on their home computer than the consumer  versions of Windows.","Good, stable, don't make it your only OS at home",951523200,22,

I'm not wild about having to go through all the proceeding steps  to get to the one I want.  Also, I don't care for the way this program sets  up printing, and don't make more than one mistake without saving because  there's only one level of undo, so if you really screw up, you have to  start over from the beginning or your last save point.  And then when you  want to ""save as"" you get to choose the Adobe PDD  format...period, unless you save for e-mail or the web then you get to  choose JPEG and a couple others.  But try to open an Adobe PDD format in  another editing program and you'll more than likely find that you can't do  it.  In it's favor, there's a lot of neat tools here and it's fairly easy  to use.  There's lots of ""cute"" stuff like the clip art and the  seasonal add-ons that the program automatically notifies you of so you can  put the CD in and load it if you're into that sort of stuff.

A wide variety of image-editing tools are available in the program that allow you to manipulate the brightness and contrast controls, color options and picture/canvas size.  There are also commands for adding borders and shadows; fixing red-eye syndrome; changing an image's focus; and removing dust, noise, and patterns.  Both guided activities and the advanced menu can be used for accessing painting, layers, and type tools; adjusting color, and working through special projects such as creating wallpaper and sending images via e-mail.

Also could not change where the program wanted to store pictures. I want to put pictures in a subfolder under my documents so I can do easier backups. But Photodeluxe doesn't have an option (that I could find) for using a directory other than the default of the program directory.

Last Saturday (March 25, 2000), my 4-year old nephew and I went out to get ""project stuff"" (paint, glitter, etc.) to play with.  IMAGINE OUR SURPRISE AND DELIGHT when we came across what was  apparently the ONLY copy of Pajama Sam 3 in the store!  (How it got there  ahead of the April ship date, I don't know.)  Suffice it to say, the  4-year old ""rules the roost"", and the pocketbook, so I bought it  for him and we played it that evening.
Pajama Sam 3 has the same level of  fun and challenge as Pajama Sam 1.  In #3, Pajama Sam has to find four  missing peace delegates, who represent the food groups (of the food  pyramid).  Maybe I'm spoiled, but P.S. 3 did not live up to the fantastic  work done on P.S. 2.  I believe it to be an excellent entry in the P.S.  series, but out of 5 stars (with P.S. 2 a solid 5), Pajama Sam 3 gets 4.25  to 4.5.  The subject matter (the food group) seemed more of an attempt to  get kids thinking about healthy eating, rather than the excitement of the  chase.  PLUS, there was nothing to print out once all of the 20 ""box  tops"" were collected.  Also, I did not notice (granted, did not look  for) any additional ""side games"", as there was in Pajama Sam  2.
Make no minstake about it, my nephew and I both loved P.S. 3 (we  figured it out on the first run through, which took a total of 2.5 hours);  but I guess I was looking for more excitement or more of a  challenge.

What the program offers: 1)complete integration and compatibility of program functions, 2) 3D rendered walkthroughs, 3) the ability to build custom furniture models, 4) the ability to build a physical scale model of the design
Those are really neat sounding features, but they do not make up for the software's faults.
For one, the floor plan design tools are somewhat counter-intuitive. I found that I couldn't break a wall in two, and the auto dimensions were not helpful in determining the locations of any interior walls. It is impossible to copy and paste doors and windows. Unlike 3D Home Architect, most objects do not recognize when they are against a wall.
Particularly annoying was kitchen design. This thing behaves more like modified rendering software than a home designer. When you start placing cabinets, the selection looks neat already rendered, but I could not tell if they had doors or drawers! The selection of cabinets that I could identify was woefully inadequate, and when placed the sizes were a little off.
After trying to design a kitchen I didn't even try the other features. If home design software can't get a kitchen right it's otherwise useless!
So I say if you want to build a model of your house, get the cheaper 3D Home Architect 3.0, print out a floorplan, and get a modeling kit. Believe me, you'll still save time over using Professional Home Design.",No! Stop! There's a better way!,987206400,38,

(1) Multiple calendars - you can have up to 31 base calanders per project, giving you absolute control that is not possible with other PM applications in this price range.  This feature allows you to model different resource baselines, which is powerful.  Also, unlike MS Project, SureTrak does not assume it knows better than you and change the project in strange and mysterious ways after you've made an adjustment.  This alone makes SureTrak worth using.
(2) Earned Value project management is built in and works correctly.  If you're a PMP you'll not only appreciate the solid implementation of earned value, but should also know that the earned value portions of the PMBOK were developed by members of the Primavera team--Quentin Fleming and Joel Koppelman--who also authored Earned Value Project Management, second edition.  This adds a high level of trust in the way SureTrak works.
(3)  Project resource leveling works (it's somewhat 'challenged' in MS Project), and the ability to automatically forecast resource shortages, trace PERT logic, use precedence diagramming method if you so choose, and the ability to jump from WBS, resource, activity or PERT views with a mouse click shows your project from any perspective.  Another nice feature is the 'cosmic' view of the PERT view that shows the entire network in one window and details in another.
(4)  The reports, profiling and analysis options are too many to list.  Suffice it to say that if there is a view or report that isn't shipped with SureTrak (and I cannot think of any), you can easily create one.
Although it has serious features, it also has glitz:  publish in HTML, add graphics to your schedule and customize bar legends.  It also has team features, such as email management, the ability to manage multiple related projects simultaneously, and the ability to exchange files with MS Project via MPX files.  Note that there are some losses when you exchange MPX files because SureTrak has features that Project doesn't have and they will not import correctly into MS Project.
If you make the leap from MS Project to SureTrak I strongly recommend investing in Planning Using Primavera SureTrak Project Manager Version 3.0 by Paul E. Harris, which will get you quickly started.",Best single-user PM software bar none,1019433600,78,

The features that align to the PMBOK are:  easy planning using a work breakdown structure, correct computations for earned value and resource leveling that works properly.
Features that I particularly like are:  direct import of data into an Excel pivot table (this feature has been in the program since version 1.0, and takes a mouse click to accomplish), wide array of reports, and the ability to switch among Gantt (schedule in bar graph format), organizational view, work breakdown structure view and PERT view, and the ability to export and import between Microsoft Project using the MPX file format. While MS Project is not my tool of choice I have to adapt to what clients are using and it is a common application.
How does SureTrak compare to Microsoft Project? It depends on your approach to project management.  If you consider Gantt charts to be a project plan and you can get away with it, then stick with MS Project.  However, if you begin your planning and estimating with a work breakdown structure, analyze dependencies and find your critical path using an activity diagram, and are managing to deliverables using earned value, then SureTrak is the way to go.
Here are a few other facts that commend SureTrak:  Primavera is a widely respected brand for high end project management software, such as their P3 product. Nearly every major engineering and construction project on the planet is managed with P3. They also played a key role in defining the earned value project management portion of the PMBOK 2000, which is not an international standard for project management.  The makers of MS Project, on the other hand, is known for missed product releases.

It is both cheaper and better than Triple Play and the other PS2 baseball games,so you think what makes this game so special,a lot of things. For striking out a batter you get a special which can be used 3 times. To name just a few Elevator,Heater,Corkscrew and Spitball. A Heater is the same as a fastball,but thrown twice as hard. I think most of you know what a spitball is. An elevator is my favorite pitch(that I have unlocked yet,anyway.)After the pitcher releases the baseball it rolls on the ground but when it reaches the plate it goes where you wanted to throw it. Corkscrew looks like a slowball until it reaches the plate spins around a few times then goes where you wanted it to go. Plus you just keep unlocking more when you strike someone out. Now to the batting,you have a little white symbol shaped like a bat which you move around you see a baseball which is where the pitcher is going to throw the ball. There are four boxes on the right side of what you hope to do with the ball if you make contact:power,line drive which is default,grounder or bunt. At first it is a little hard making contact but in a short period of time you will be getting hits easily. Because the players are kids not pros,they make mistakes often on easy(I mean CPU players)you can beat out a bunt,beat out a grounder,turn a single into a double,turn a doubles into triples into homeruns,which is very exciting. This is what makes the game so great,cool batting and great pitching. Also if you get a double play,you get what is called an undergrounder. It is one of the hitting choices with line drive,grounder,etc.,etc. The undergrounder is very cool, when you hit the ball it goes underground for a while. During this time your hitter runs the bases then when they have touched second the ball pops out of the outfield wall,in the confusion your player is still running,if the opposing team has great defense you will get a triple. If they have bad defense you will get an inside the park homerun. Hitting is overall good. Now to defense,defense is ok but could have been better. You click the ball to get it not very entertaining,but ok. Running the bases is fun click to go to next base. Click a small icon in the upper left corner to steal.

I happen to be a web  designer and use this tablet for many things.  Using the mouse for extended  periods of time causes my wrist to ache!  Now, with my Pablo, I don't have  to stop working to ease the pain.
The tablet area (6x8) represents your  screen (to scale)!  Not like the mouse where you sometimes have to move it  around to find the pointer. With Pablo, the ""START"" button is  always in the lower left corner...just place the pen over that area and  push!
While it's a little unorthodox at first...if you know how to write  with a pen you'll be comfortable with it in no time at all!
Adding the  software can be as easy as inserting the CD-ROM and plugging it in!(**See  my comment below about this!) There's only one cord to connect...the USB  Port!  There aren't any lengthy installations.
More perks!  I comes  with over $200.00 worth of bundled software, including Adobe Photoshop 5.0  LE, Adobe PageMill 3.0 and WebPainter 3.0!
FOR GRAPHIC ARTISTS AND WEB  DESIGNERS:  Have you ever tried to draw with a mouse!  The accuracy  stinks...especially if your mouse is sensitive to movement (which is the  whole point of a mouse).  This pen and tablet combo allows you the freedom  to freehand without the hassle of having to UNDO 7 times before it looks  right!
So you're probably wondering if there are any ""CONS""  to this product...here they are in a nutshell!
1.  No REAL user's manual  that suggests tips and maybe a tutorial to allow the user to explore the  full capability of this product.  Although it IS pretty straight forward.  My only question about use brings me to ""CON"" #2.
2.  When I am  drawing in an image editing program, it may continue to draw after I've  finished applying pressure with the pen.  Why?  How do I prevent this from  happening?
**3.  I happened to encounter a small problem installing the  software because the user's manual (term used lightly) does not tell you to  install the software first and then plug in your gadget.  For some this may  be common knowledge but for those of you anxious to check it out (not  knowing or paying attention) doing this in any order may cause you trouble.  The good news is that KB GEAR (makers of the Pablo) has a troubleshooting  section on their website that walked me through some CRAZY stuff (stuff I  didn't know I had) and had me up and running in about 10 minutes!  I was  very impressed.  Not like some companies where you're on the phone for 45  mins. with tech support (usually LONG DISTANCE)!
All in all, there is a  long list of benefits...like the $20.00 manufacturer's rebate inside the  box!  This is the ONLY tablet of it's kind for this price!  A similar  product by WACOM is almost twice the price!

My students seem to get bored of the Baby software too quickly (even my 1 year old students migrate away from the Baby game and over to the Toddler game when given a choice).

His dad is an IT Administrator so our son was around computers all the time.  Also, he was (and still is not) interested in learning the traditional way (through books, play, etc.), but rather through computers.  We were NOT disappointed with this piece of software!  Through this program my son has learned most of the alphabet, shapes, numbers and colors.  We have had this one for about six months and he has not lost interest in it.
However, there are some things that I was not pleased with.  First, this product is recommended for children 18 months-3 years.  It would probably be more suited for children 2 1/2 to 4 simply because it requires basic knowledge of how to use a mouse and the program does NOT teach this skill.  Also, the concepts it teaches (letters, numbers, shapes, colors, music, animals, memory skills, etc.) are more geared toward the preschool crowd.  Second, the layout is ""busy"" and it is hard to see all of the different entrance areas (even for me an adult). Finally, another minor complaint (it is very minor) is that the duck's voice can get annoying after 15 minutes or so for me, but my son enjoys it so this is tolerable.

In fact, some of them are so simple and shallow that it's hard to believe there isn't more to them that is inaccessible somehow due to a programming flaw.  The butterfly selector is confusing and requires adult assistance.  The program comes with two levels of play, and the level selector pops up anytime the mouse nears the bottom of the screen.  This is bad because many of the child's activity zones are also located at the bottom of the screen.  This means the level selector gets launched inadvertently every few minutes.  The selector then covers up the section of the screen that the child is playing with.  In addition, the level selector doesn't work according to the steps laid out in the directions.  My husband and I are both multimedia developers and neither of us can figure this selector out.  Our son enjoys 2 of the 6 activities, so I feel we got somewhat of our money's-worth.

If you touch an animal, you can now turn into that animal. Each animal has its own abilities, and with the wide variety of animals you have to choose from, it makes for interesting puzzle solving. Do you fly to get out a window? Jump over the pits instead?
The graphics are very nice - again, it's shape-oriented rendering much like console games. Combat is a bit tedious, but it's slow pacing makes it easier for younger gamers to get their combinations in before their turn is up. Unlimited inventory means you simply pick up whatever you find, and figure out where to use the items.
There are nice training areas to teach you how to do the action sequences (running down paths jumping over tree trunks is typical) and how to fight. The gameplay itself is very easy to follow - you are given clues to help move you along from location to location.

I've been noticing complaints about the game's character Polly. I hope customers realize that Polly is the antagonist in the game and Botley is the protagonist that encourages you and helps you throughout the game. Even though Polly is mean to the player (very rarely!), she is a really fun character and my sister and I enjoyed her character. She was quirky for a 3rd grader!

This game is great for any young child because it exposes them to:

math (multiplication, addition, subtraction, fractions using a cooking robot!)
history (they go into the past a lot and talk about what polly changed)
art (the art room really exposed me a lot to the art world. that's where i learned about georgia o'keefe!)
biology (the biome maze was hard for us but i learned what a savanna was)
creativity (come on, a time travel machine?!)

This game has so much potential to really get your kids' brains kicking. I'm going to let my little cousin play this!

The only problem was that I found it really repetitive. You had to get back ~50 robots from the past so that was quite tedious. But by the time your kid finishes this game, they'd be out of 3rd grade!

One game on the disks was this game. I played it day in and day out. I loved this game to death...until I beat it of course. Now (with permission from my parents) I feel that I should review it now since my typing skills at 7 weren't all that great. I'm 15 now and I've been looking for this game for years. I know it's for 3rd graders, but the games that are my teens my age are dull and boring and not as fun as the games I used to play as a kid. I will admit that some parts of the game I did not understand at all, so I basically went through the game guessing instead of thinking, but I still thought it was fun when Polly's father finally caught up to what she was doing. I think that if I were to buy this product again I would be able to actually understand the challenges I went up against and maybe I wouldn't win with just pure luck. Buying Jump Start again would most definitely not be a mistake on my part. I found that playing educational computer games as a child can really help you when you advance in grades.

For the parents whose children couldn't quite grasp the game or made them upset because it was frustrating you can't really blame the game because it does teach your child valuable stuff. They might not remember it right after they play the game, but in high school it'll all come back to them.

The premise is that a bratty girl named Polly has sent 25 robots back in time to alter history.  Your job, along with Botley your trusty sidekick robot, is to pick up the clues, go back in time, and bring the robots back so that history isn't altered.  There are three levels of difficulty that you can set.  The easiest is perfect for entering 3rd graders, and the hardest is pretty challenging.  Each of the 25 robots is associated with a historical event, and by the time you get all 4 clues needed to ""rescue"" the robot, you know the who, what, when and where of the event (i.e., the discovery of radium or the first human paintings).

In order to get all 25 robots back, your child will have to work through math drills, word scrambles, ""pong"" type dexterity games, logic games, picture drawing, music, astronomy, biology, ecology, art history, and quantitative reasoning.

The genius of the Jump Start team is that they made the game so darn fun that my son really enjoyed playing it again and again.  The robots are exceptionally well done, with the voices, mouth movement and speech well coordinated.  Mort, the robot in the kitchen, is especially funny, as is Monty Monitor.

My dad had bought many educational games for me when I was younger and I can honestly say hands down this has been by far my favorite one out of all of them.

The point is not to have every character be sickeningly sweet; half the fun is Polly being such a brat, making her the antagonist that you and Botley must work against as the heroes of the game. It also makes you feel that much better when her father finally comes around and sees all the shenanigans she's been up to. If a child ended up crying because of this, I would not blame it on the game, I would see it as the child's inability to differentiate between reality and fiction and gently explain the situation to them. If everything were tailored to be inoffensive, then God help us all because we would not have any Disney, Looney Toons, or fairy tales and we would all be drowning in the mind-numbing sing-a-longs of Blues Clues and Barney forever.

The program features great theories on story development and structure.  It has some great insights on how to add depth and emotional complexity into your stories however...

The program is poorly constructed and does not do a good job of explaining HOW to use the program and WHAT some of the concepts actually mean.

1)  Poor program constuction and unclear interface - Something as simple as the font on the screen cannot be adjusted.  There were no visual illustrations directing me where to go.  I started with the ""Start Here"" button and proceeded to answer its various questions but after hours and hours of work, I got lost in the forest.  There are no navigation buttons or models to tell you what the end result should look like.  If the final product is a printed treatment, can't I just use the Dramatica inspired questions and write this up on a MS Word document?

2)  Poor instruction manual - As part of its ""attempt"" to explain to me what its vague story concepts are, a comic book and a matrix was added to the package.  What the creators of this program have to understand is that there definitions are not universally accepted terms -- most of them are not even industry used terms.  Unless a user spends hours and hours trying to decipher what its terminology means, there is no way anyone can hope to understand what they are trying to say.

The end result is a frustrating and outdated mess.  There are apparently 4 versions of this program (I got version 4) but the look and feel of this program seems like it was from 1990.

The first time I opened it, I was aghast at how ugly it was. All of the questions seemed elementary and silly to me and I felt like it was a huge waste of time. I shut it down and walked away from it. Then, about fifteen minutes later I realized what I had done in the short span of time of fiddling around with the program. I'd added multiple characters to a novel that I'd been struggling with, added tension and drama, and found ways to get over the problems with it that had been causing my writer's block.

So I opened Dramatica Pro right back up again.

I worked on it late into the evening, filling out information on my characters and plot. It was exhausting and irritating at times, and there were a lot of things that didn't apply to my plot. Simply ignoring the aspects that didn't add anything to the novel didn't seem to hurt anything, though, and by having to think about whether or not something DID add something to the novel made me consider things in ways I hadn't before. I discovered depth and symbolism and themes I hadn't even considered, simply by having to answer question after question after question.

When I woke up in the morning, the first thing I wanted to do was get started on the scene by scene breakdown of the novel. On each scene, it reminds you of different aspects of your story and characters. Again, you don't have to follow the formula they lay out for you. If it doesn't make sense to introduce your antagonist in chapter two then simply don't do it. This is all here for guidance and inspiration, it's not something written in stone.

The drawback is that at some point it reaches almost ridiculous levels of detail, leaving you just to fill in the scenes.

You can build a story using this software by generating character templates and then answering questions about the themes and relationships within the story.  You can jot notes all along the way, but I found I was writing the same thing down over and over again.  Eventually that pays off when your getting towards the end and the notes are already there, but it is long, tedious, and not fun.  You start with almost 33,000 possible storylines that narrow down to one and then you can map out your Chapters and export everything to a word processor to print out.  You can use the print out as your personal guide and then start writing your story.  Characters can be complex or straight archetype templates.  I think when you get focused on the templates it narrows the possibilities for dynamic and interesting people.  A hero isn't always hero-like, but it is good to know the basic archetypes.  I also found the templates greatly reduce the possibilities for the story's theme and progression.  I did not want my hero to only be logical and then only be able to be categorized as a do-er...these things kind of killed my storyline altogether, but I am sure it created a storyline that I could have worked with instead.

The demo does not let you print, export or save so I do not know if the reports were any good or not.  I do not know if they were clear cut or just a lot of additional information I may or may not need.

I found the process a lot of boring busy work and not much fun.  It has a nice interface and is easy enough to use, but it doesn't allow for a lot of creativity or research notes.  The tutorial was simply a lot of reading, but easy to understand.

Don't be swayed by those who say this software is difficult to use, and don't be swayed by those who say it's not.  I feel that, for those who are able to use most softwares intuitively, it isn't particularly difficult. Although it isn't perfect, there are very few - if any - softwares that are.  It all depends upon you.  And in Dramatica's case, once you get past that hurdle it very quickly becomes a breeze to use.

No, I don't feel that it supplants my creativity.  But that's more likely because I don't allow it to.

As for writer's block, there are established ways of getting over that, and - for me - they do not include the use of a computer.

The main problem I have is lack of persistence of focus.  And, as a cure for that, it's excellent.

What has it done for me?

It's given me a much greater focus on and control over the mechanics of ordering my thoughts.  Sure, I could use index cards, but they're very unwieldy.  As a replacement for them, Dramatica has been more of a boon than a relational database has ever been.  All the benefits without the programming.

There are different ways of using Dramatica.  I've already got a good idea about my characters and how the plot progresses before I begin.  Most often, I use character building and the many different reports to complement.

The various input options, such as character building, are very helpful for noting down important elements and ensuring the continuity of them.

I rarely use the brainstorming option, but it's there if I am well and truly mired in a loop.

To sum up: horses for riders, not so much for courses.

Don't be swayed by negative or positive reviews.  Use the trial version as long as you can, make sure you use it as a partner, a tool, and not the universal panacea, and you'll find out if it is right for you.

And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you!  When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons. Come on now.

Progress was slow to begin with, mostly because one needs to be patient and go through it all, ( a few times) in good order, to avoid getting mightily confused, since a great deal of the explanation is often another way to convey what is already known - sort of - from many other sources.

The dramatica model is surprisingly general and adds quite a bit of force to your story without constricting creative freedom. Some structures, like a ladder, provide more freedom, not less, and Dramatica's structure is like that.
If the idea of following the dramatica story model still seems formulaic to you, you are free to tweak it or change it as much as you want, or even use it's best ideas to form your own model. The point is that a sophisticated model produces a sophisticated story.
The software is actually quite easy to use. The hard part is learning the model, because it is quite sophisticated. It will take a few weeks to get it, and probably a couple of tries to make it really work well for you.

By this I mean, that to convey the principles of Dramatica the prior art examples are  either too archetypical with no real requirement for the use of Dramatica by those who intend writing such archetypes, or are too flawed so that they do Dramatica no favours due to them being little more than the nearest point of common reference.
But by treating Dramatica as a philosophy and an abstraction, and not using it to see how prior art can be aligned to its principles, one can quickly see how Dramatica will enable the writer to create stories and forms hitherto unattainable, simply  because the organisation of the story's elements and form would have been too difficult to keep track of.
Therefore, in order to get the desired results from using Dramatica, the user has to gain expertise in the way of defining and structuring a story's elements with Dramatica, and not be trying to defend the outcome on prior art which is a close call. This is the hard part to Dramatica, since  ideal prior art probably doesn't exist, from which to refer,  except for the possibility of future works skilfully created with Dramatica.

If you're selling your Titantic to Paramount -- don't use this software. The only reason format really matters in screenwriting is for 'selective elimination'. There are simply too many scripts to be read out there... they drastically reduce headcount on format alone.

That being said... If you are a small time filmmaker and you aren't uptight about ""how things have to be"" than this will work fine for you. This is also a much better option for those who have a moral compass and do not like stealing more expensive software. Just use the cheaper alternative because guess why -- it works.

Also, I am rating our product at 3 stars because I do not think it would be proper for me to rate it in a way that would affect the average rating.

First time I noticed a problem was when I tried to email my script to a friend for comments - you can't. Unless the other person has Hollywood Screenwriter, they won't be able to open it. The program doesn't even allow you to cut your text into a Word document (or any other application for that matter.)

ANSWER

You can copy or paste into other programs now and you could always save as an RTF file. Which would allow you to share your script.

 Secondly, the top and bottom margins were set at 1.5 inches so for several weeks I thought my script was much longer than it actually was. The margins are easily corrected, but still, 1 inch is proper industry format - they should know that.

ANSWER

This has been corrected in all of the available formats.

Third, the spacing between scene headings is incorrect. Proper industry format says three spaces, this program gives you two. I had to go in and hit a hard return at the beginning of every scene heading in a hundred page script - very annoying.

ANSWER

Actually the program has always given you several different formats of screenplay to use, including one that gives you triple spaces.

 Fourth, you can not incorporate a (beat) into the dialogue. As soon as you type a parantheses, the program thinks its acting instructions and formats whatever is in the () accordingly. On the online FAQ they recognize this problem and say to use [] or {} for beats!!! That's great, try to break into the business by having your script look different than other professional scripts. I don't think so. I makes me wonder what other formatting stlyle is incorrect.

ANSWER

By Holding the Control Key while typing the Parenthesis it will place it in your dialogue.

Finally, and this is a doozy, at any point you can go and try to open a script you've been working on forever and find that it isn't there. The program gives an Error 32, whatever that means, and opens up what it calls your script but is actually one blank page. The company's online help has an update you can download to fix this problem and after the download, you'll supposedly be able to recover your script. Didn't work for me. I opened an older version I had and then re-did my work to the best of my memory. Now, this morning, I popped the CD in and...nothing. The program won't open at all.

The Error 32 is absolutely fixed in the current version that is shipping, so this should not be a problem. If it did not work for this user, than more than likely the update was not installed correctly.

Another quote, ""But for us creative types, I guess that's not needed - we've always got new and fresh ideas!"" Seriously, tell me you're kidding. Apparently not, he keeps going with ""This type of thing is mainly for those of us who truly have a future in the business, not the pretenders."" (sound of one man throwing up).

Who knows, but until it does I'm content to practice what I feel is my true gift, reviewing.  But while I'm honing my craft as a reviewer, hoping to be published one day, I still like to work on my other dreams, like screenwriting (and stand-up comedy).

That's where this program comes in handy.  I type in my characters and locations, and it helps me input them automatically, saving loads of time while I write.  In fact, the software is so easy to use, I completed two screenplays within a week of owning it: ""The Next Karate Kid, Part II"", and ""Stardrivers"", which is about an intergalactic space race to the sun.  I'm now working on a Howdy Doody feature film, an action film called ""Bloodthirsty"" that I think could be Scott Baio's ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Stardrivers 2"".  It's helped me realize that I really am a truly gifted writer, and that everyone who has doubted my abilities was just a hurdle on my way to success.

Are there any flaws in the program?  Well, it's a little disappointing that the software doesn't come with any screenplay ideas built in, to help with the writer's block that occasionally sets in.  But for us creative types, I guess that's not needed - we've always got new and fresh ideas!  This software is not for everyone, though - for the vast majority of you reading this, you'll never see a screenplay published, so perhaps you should consider another hobby or long-term project.

From the reviews that I have read here, I may be in the minority, but Cakewalk's Pyro has been a wonderful program to work with.  I have only had to toss a bad CD a couple times in dozens of instances - a vast improvment from the stack of ""coasters"" that piled up with other programs.
What I particularly liked about Pyro was its ability to work with different file formats (and in my experience successful complete one). You can burn MP3s right onto a CD without converting it to another file format. Additionally, I have heavily used the ""ripping"" feature which allows you to convert your own CDs to digital files (MP3s, WAVs, etc.).  It also allows you to set a bitrate for your ""ripped"" music to help control the sometimes out-of-control files sizes (I have well over a gigabtye of MP3s on my computer right now these files tend to take up. Another terrific feature is that when you load a CD to ""rip"" you can download the CD's song titles and artist(s) via CD Database (CDDB) -- so no typing in file names! (The registration for this service is free and I have not received any spam e-mails from it). The audio player in the program seems more stable than other players (i.e. RealPlayer)  I have used - though it certainly is not a full-featured ""jukebox"" type program. Finally, another nice Pyro feature is the ability to put in customized gaps between tracks prior to burning.
However, I am taking away one star for one fairly consistent problem. Pyro, at times, is unable to recognize MP3 downloads from that very popular online music ""sharing"" community.  Often these MP3 files are said to be ""corrupted"" or not in the proper format (and thus can not be listened to and/or burned with Pyro). The same files DO work on other players and programs that I have. So this is my only substantive complaint with the program.  For those with high speed modems, it might not take long to replace it with another file but for me and my measly phone line modem it is not worth the time.
Overall, I have been very pleased with Pyro.  It has saved me a lot of time and aggravation and the ripping ability/features was worth the price of the software alone.

If you missed Borg, it involved about 2 hours of playing time that could be watched as a ~40 minute ""movie"" when you were  finished. Here, this is compressed for the MTV generation as about 1 hour of playing time for ~20 minutes of actual material. Guess they didn't want to worry about the second CD.
Graphics in the game are about what you'd expect from a 2D animation heroine - although the backgrounds in the ""cut scenes"" noticably lack detail, and the repetitive reuse of Trent for level transitions gets annoying. There's only about 20 minutes of material on this CD, couldn't they at least put a change in there?
Gameplay is, well.... insulting to Daria fans. This CD is marked as rated for teenagers 13+. Most Daria fans I've seen on the net are between 15 and 45 (I'm almost 30). The mindset needed for this game to be an actual puzzle would be about 5, however. Every object in the game has a use, but there are only about  30 total objects, almost all of which you literally CAN NOT miss. If their use weren't extremely obvious already (what would you try to do first with a garage door opener with a garage nearby, for example?) - the Sick Sad World segments spell it completely out for you. Kevin Thompson could beat this game in a day.
I must admit that there is one challenge however -- not getting so irritated at the interface that you use the CD as a frisbee. Movement of Daria is controlled with either the keyboard arrow keys (with _no_ use of diagonals on the keypad) or the mouse. Unfortunately, application of items on ""irritants"" aka enemies is _also_ with the same mouse button. Miss by a pixel and you walk straight into what you were trying to negate. I guess this was needed for the Mac port (I know 2+ button mice for Macs _exist_ but they are an option, after all...).
Setting aside the above -- is it worth it? Well, if you have a child of 5 or 6, sure. It's a fun little game. Otherwise,  you _must_ be a fan of the show to enjoy this game. A rabid fan, possibly. There are gems for the fans, including an extended version of the show's theme ""You're Standing on my Neck"" by Splendora in the credits.

GENERAL COMMENTS:
I first tried StarOffice 5.1 on a very unstable Win98 machine, with mixed luck. Version 5.2 behaved much better on it. Now I have StarOffice 5.2 on a WinXP machine, and it works well.
I would have given it 5 stars, but the learning curve for someone used to MS products is rather steep, unless you're doing plain vanilla stuff, and I must admit I haven't had the time to really learn the various components yet.
I do plan to learn to use it well and hopefully replace the equivalent MS products with it --the only thing keeping me from doing it right now is that I'm heavily dependent on Office macros and templates, so it's faster to just use Office for now.  But the moment I have the time to figure out how to fully import or re-do all my macros and templates in StarOffice, it's goodbye Word!
FIXING WORD DOCS:
What I use it for most of the time is to fix Word 97 and Word 2000 documents, which have an unfortunate penchant for becoming corrupted, specially when you use both headers and footers with automatic insertion of page numbers, date, and time (as many of us ""baldies-from-pulling-our-hair-out-with-MS-products"" know).
If a Word or .RTF doc has become corrupted, rather than spending hours dinking with it in Office, I import it into StarOffice, then do a ""save as"" back into Word 97/2000 format - lo and behold, I then have a perfectly healthy Word document!
WORD OF CAUTION:
You WILL have to dink with some of the formatting once you're back in Word, as some things can be lost at times --for instance, some table settings like spacing between cells (and it's easy to fix).  But the time spent tweaking it back to the way it was is WAY less, and far less frustrating, than trying to fix the corrupted document in Office!
CONCLUSION:
If you find that your Word or .RTF docs glitch fairly often, then do try out StarOffice as a cure. This alone is more than worth the asking price!",Got a corrupted Word doc? Fix it with StarOffice!,1017878400,6,

Nothing for Mac users yet, but it runs on Windows and Linux and Solaris, and that covers a lot of people.
I've used it for about 6 months and I have no idea why anyone would still be flinging their money at MS Office. StarOffice isn't perfect, but neither, by a long shot, is MS Office. (I think the last time Word was a good product was 1995, on a Mac.) StarOffice is kind of like a proxy to MS Office--it reads and writes all the Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. files that everyone sends you, and you can send anyone a StarOffice file in the MS Office file of their choice. But, of course, you don't have to actually have or PAY for MS Office. And you get a couple nice little drawing/picture editing programs that can do pretty decent stuff. (Not a substitute for PhotoShop, but PhotoShop is $700.) I was messing around with old college files in Corel and WordStar, and StarOffice even opened those.
You're probably going to need a book to use it fully. It's not hard to get started and do basic stuff, there's lots of wizards and everything, but every time you right-click there's 10 more features that you'll be able to use a lot easier if you've got a book. I strongly recommend ""StarOffice Companion"" by Floyd Jones.

The latest version 5.2 is available on CD-ROMfrom SUN... (you ""heard"" me right!) and alternatively you may download it from SUN's website. But don't let the low low price fool you or sway you from getting a copy now! I once looked up the price back when this product was StarDivision property, and it was in the range of 500 Deutche Marks (I'll let you do the monetary translation.)
StarOffice is available natively for the following operating system platforms: Linux, Solaris, and Windows. Version 5.1b is still available for OS/2 users.  As a side note, SUN also has a ""StarPortal"" version initiative going on to bring Office productivity services via the internet.
StarOffice consists of the following fully integrated applications: Wordprocessor, Spreadsheet, Presentation, Scheduler, Graphics/Drawing, Email, Database, GUI FTP-client, GUI HTML-editor, and more. Users moving to StarOffice can open and edit their old MS Word, Excel and Powerpoint, Lotus Amipro/Word or 123 files, but many more file formats are supported including StarOffice native file formats. Webmasters can build HTML websites withStarOffice's HTML GUI-editor, Java support, graphics tools, and full FTP client to make editing and saving web documents up on the server or locally fully seamless. Email support includes POP3/IMAP/LDAP/SENDMAIL/NEWS, and you can setup multiple email accounts simultaneously.
StarOffice installs in about 15 minutes (with server or local options possible), looks and feels exactly the same across platforms, and you can run it as an independent application or as your replacement desktop. It has it's own ""Start Menu"" that presents you with all your programs, as well as all your desktop icons. You can see a great deal of thought went into the design of this product with an integrated workspace in mind.
Office managers looking to save money by avoiding more expensive products and licensing issues may find their holy grail in StarOffice from SUN, with the added benefit of support for multiple computer platforms.  Home computer users will save a bundle too, and yet still be able to work with their old MS Word documents, etc.

The games certainly help students with problem solving and thinking in new ways. Although the math was on level, I felt the language arts section was a bit behind fourth grade level.

This particular game is one of my favorites, partially because the plotline is the most interesting and the games still challenge me even though I'm no longer in fifth grade (Which makes me sound stupid I guess)

To start off, I'll talk about the games. The games generally combine fun with education. One game has you rearanging stories, which I find really fun, and another has you figuring out geography puzzles- like, how can you get from Iowa to Tenessee without crossing the Mississippi river? They are also challenging for most kids- though some might need adult help. For example, in that geography problem, I couldn't figure it out because I didn't realize you were allowed to cross water- the gulf of Mexico. Another game, that has you putting together electrical circuits, is also very fun- the first few times, but you don't learn anything new by having to repeat it twelve times. But overall they are fun, and fairly educational and challenging- I'm not very good at judging educational value; keep that in mind hearing that.

I probably already said I love the plotline. This is where Cluefinder's games really stand out; they interwind the plotline with the games so well I don't find it irritating. The characters are also funny and interesting. Although this plotline seriously tests your suspension of disbelief, I usually put up with it because it's entertaining and makes the game fun. And it's not good to be analytical I guess. It also is a good motivater to continue the game- they keep the plotline moving as you play, so there aren't many 'dry' patches where you play games forever without plot incentive.

Cluefinders Software is a great way for your child to review educational skills while having a whole lot of fun. And if you're just looking for a fun game- hey, it's good for that too. I highly recommend it.

As someone who works with 4+ languages on a daily basis, I also enjoy studying languages as a hobby. It was fascinating to see some of the lesser studied European languages and variants such as Asturian, Provenal, Basque, and Catalan.
The games provided are great for reviewing or brushing up on vocabulary and grammar. Recording conversations and completing dialogues was also very helpful to get a feel for phrasing and pronunciation.
It is refreshing to see a software company taking the effort to enlist native speakers and record unusual languages, such as Blackfoot, Quechua, Hawaiian, Welsh, Xhosa, Wolof, and even some that I was not familiar with.
The important thing to remember is that no, using this product will not make you fluent. It will introduce you to grammar, pronunciation, culture, and common phrases. Native speakers are a plus, but I did not like the fact that languages that made use of symbols rather than letters were Romanized, such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc. In the long run it is much more difficult to pick up the symbols after learning the language.

4553,4,FALSE,"10 28, 2000",A37VTXJCFOREVJ,B00004UFGD,,Amazon Customer,"When I first got this product, I had several hopes for it.  First, that--due to the ability to hear the language, and compare my pronunciation with it--I could get the ""feel"" of many languages I hadn't been able to grasp before, due to lack of contact with native speakers.
I wanted this, NOT so much to become fluent in the languages, as to be able to use common phrases of meeting and shopping when visiting other countries or when entertaining foreign visitors--both of which happen frequently for my husband and myself. I had noticed that if I simply TRIED to speak their language, most people would switch to English to accomodate me, but do it cheerfully.  In most cases, they would have done it anyway, since I couldn't speak their language--but not so happily. This changed everything.
I mean, a realistic Croat or Lithuanian won't expect most  Americans to speak their language, but a few words of friendly greeting--a mere attempt--make all the difference in their feeling respected, welcomed, and ""at home"" with us.
Second, I wanted the benefits of understanding more about the world's cultures I might never be exposed to otherwise.  For example, working with the language of a people helps when you read their history, as well.
For instance, just after studying the segment on Basque, I bought a volume of Basque history, and was amazed at how much more I understood due to this language program. Family names, city names, and so on are words in the language, so you have a much more vivid impression of the place and people.
It's like knowing that a place-name like ""Bear Mountain"" is a mountain where there were bears, rather than just knowing the sounds of the name, such as ""Boca Raton"" which means ""mouse's mouth"" only if you know the original language (Spanish).
It's wonderful for my grandchildren to use, as well, since they see learning the words and phrases as a game--and they pick up languages, and the correct pronunications, faster than adults.  And they get used to the idea that there are a lot of other languages, instead of believing that ""everyone"" speaks English.
Why didn't I say ""five stars"" for this product?

4566,5,FALSE,"09 19, 2000",A3L5PEQP8NIO5D,B00004VX5C,,Tom,"One day there was a little boy named Linus Torvalds. He liked to play with  computers and get them to do things. And on one very special and fateful  day, he was astounded by a friend of his who was using something called  UNIX. It was better, faster and did more than anything he'd ever seen  before. ""Where can I get this UNIX?"" he asked? ""And for how  much?"" That day he learned that not everyone could use UNIX. It was  expensive. So, being a savvy, industrius and inventive little tyke, Linus  set about writing his own version. It would be called LINUX, it would be  every ounce as powerful, and would be free! And every little boy and girl  could make their own improvements because he would give away the source  code! ...Of all the LINUX distributions, SLACKWARE has been defined as the  most 'UNIX'-like. It is also among the oldest, most developed and often the  most advanced of the LINUX flavors. All of that aside, I found it to be the  most useful way to learn to use LINUX. Let me explain... The installer is a  script, with a less than impressive 'DOS' looking interface. But do not let  the look fool you. Under the hood, it is every ounce the musclebound  goliath you want it to be. Don't judge a distribution based on this; they  may look different, but most installers have the same general set of  options. Pay attention to the screen when linux is booting whether off of  floppies or CD. This will tell you some valuable things (like what  additional kinds of starage devices the kernel has already recognized in  your machine). This makes less work and less confusion later on. If you  have another drive with Windows on it, SLACKWARE can usually detect it and  make it available from within your LINUX session. If you can set up  SLACKWARE, you will do fine. Setting up XWindows is a great first lesson in  your new environment. Find out what kind of hardware you have in your  machine. SLACKWARE takes nothing for granted. You will need to tell  XWindows what kind of mouse, video card and monitor you have, and d which  display settings you would like to use. Why all the fuss? When you are done  you will already have a good working knowledge of how LINUX and XWindows  works. Using SLACKWARE means that you have a better idea of what's going on  inside LINUX. Other distributions tend to remove you from the command  prompt, which is LINUX in it's truest form. This means that you don't  really get to see how things work, and you're not 'really learning'  anything but the difference between Windows and XWindows. XWindows is not  an operating System. It is a Shell or window manager. Explorer.exe and it's  related components are the Windows Shell (the start button, Task Bar,  System Tray, Desktop and its own kind of Window Manager). This is where the  similarities end. LINUX is a much more powerful OS than Windows. Hands  Down. The operating system is the command prompt. You need to learn the  LINUX command prompt in order to understand how LINUX works. This will help  you know what's wrong when something doesn't work, and it will empower you  with a dynamic command of the LINUX OS. You almost can't set up SLACKWARE  without actually learning how it works. The books are fine and the 'man'  command can save your life, but nothing is as rewarding as realizing that  you are the reason it works. The learning curve here 'is' the reward. Other  distributions do not offer this kind of trial-by-fire approach, but when  you come out on the other side of the installation of other distributions,  you haven't learned much, if anything. Q) Why learn SLACKWARE? A) It's the  Most like UNIX. It costs next to nothing. And it is a first rate powerhouse  of an OS. Oh yeah, and you might actually 'learn' LINUX. SLACKWARE is for  those of us who want to know how things work and how to 'make' things work.  like what, you ask? Almost 90% of the internet is composed of UNIX or LINUX  clients and servers. No kidding, when asked what he thought of the growing  public interest in the internet, Bill Gates said, 'It's a phase'...'that  will pass'. Boy, he was wrong on a GALACTIC scale! But this gave LINUX  developers the opportunity to write the protocols and environments that are  the internet as we know it. LINUX out-sold Windows in Japan last year in  new OS purchases. Why? You can make LINUX anything you want it to be.  Router (internet traffic) software and Tivo (record days of Television at a  time digitally) machines and the SONY PlayStation2 (Everything from  videogames to DVD player to internet box+ a lot LOT more) software  development kit use LINUX. For example, after Microsoft had owned HotMail  for awhile, they decided that it looked silly for them to be running a mail  service on LINUX. So they set everything up on WindowsNT. And crashed for  three straight days. Now it is being run on LINUX again. Enough said. If  you do not want to know how things work, but want to use a powerful  distribution, use something else. But if you are serious about 'learning'  LINUX, SLACKWARE is as close to UNIX as you can get. And that's what's  keeping us all connected. You can have a working http (web) ftp and telnet  server in no time at all.","the ""Hacker's Unix"" of Linux distributions",969321600,23,

Candy Land Game (this one)3 stars
It looks like the board game at first glance.  You can have 1-4 players and each player takes turns clicking on the candy machine to get a card and then moves.  The 1st to reach the end wins.
You can click on each specialty picture to have a mini adventure: sorting with plumpy, throwing gumdrops at gumdrop mountain, planting candy flowers with Grandma Nut, Making patters and colors with lollopo, builing a sundae with queen frosteen, scaring lord licorice, etc.  It is mostly designed just to play around with as there are no goals at the mini stations.  My 3 yr old quickly dismissed the main game as too hard.  You have to click where your character is going to move to by yourself, and it is confusing to young kids.  But she could play around in the other areas herself.  It is good if you play with your toddler.  Ages 2-5 recommended.
Candy Land Adventure (4 stars)
King Candy was kidnapped by Lord licorice and all the candy from the candy store was taken as well.  Two kids (1-2 players) have to save king candy by going around in a roller coaster cart and helping the candy land characters.  The adventures are coloring, numbers, ABC order, matching, etc.  Each area gives you a prize and after you get them all you can rescue king candy.  There are no dice or things to roll, you just pick where you want to go next.
We got this game for our special needs pre-school.  The children love playing it, and it teaches them different things as well.  They can finish the adventure in about an hour, so they can possibly do it all in one sitting.  Or, they have a saving option that shows a picture of where they stopped in the game for easy retreival of up to 9 games.  You can play each area more than once for hours of fun.

I upgraded my machine, and found to my horror, that my personal speech files, which were extensive and built up over many months, could not be transferred to my new machine.
I tried some 'dodges' like replacing the user files on the new installation with my old ones, but the program will not allow this, its too clever for me!
Oh well. Off I went again, hours of reading & corrections!  Two months later, and I've just about got it all configured so that we work well together, and the program returns an error, and 'locks' me out!

4598,4,FALSE,"09 17, 2001",APDHKB7LMA8WL,B00004W3GS,,Merryl G,"Like several other reviews, I have used previous version of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I found this version to be superior in recognition to the others directly out of the box! You need to be diligent in correcting it, but if you are, it will improve. I find that most of the time when I have to correct something, the correct text is in the first 4 items in the correction box.
I find it is best to use it at times when you need to deal with a whole load of text; it is indeed too much work to use to dictate a word here and there. I find it easier to use it for dictation only and mostly operate the computer using my mouse.
Here are some tips:
- Dictate a phrase at a time, between 4 and 10 words, then pause for recognition.
- Check your words as they are recognized in the little floating window, so you know whether or not you need to correct as you go.
- Correcting something other than the last thing you said is problematic in applications other than the ""supported"" ones listed... but correcting the last thing you said works in most applications.
- If you're getting a lot of stray a's and the's in your documents, you may be breathing on the microphone. Move it to the side of your mouth and make sure your lips don't touch it when you talk.
- If you have a regional or ethnic accent, you may want to try a different base engine than the standard one. With this version, you have several to choose from. The standard version is very good for folks whose pronunciation doesn't differ much from the ""evening news"" type of American accent. Remember, this product was developed in Newton, Massachusetts.
- Don't believe that you will never need a keyboard or mouse again. What this product will do is to free your hands from bulk data entry, not from ALL keyboard use. It's pretty unpleasant to try to make corrections where it didn't offer you the correct one without using the keyboard.
- Make sure you have a fast processor and lots of RAM. The minimum system requirements don't give you a good user experience. I recommend at least a 500mhz Pentium II (or equivalent) and 256meg of RAM.
- It works VERY well in Microsoft Word, doing almost everything that it does in DragonPad. It's not bad in most places in America Online, unless you're using PowerTools. (It gets very slow in the chat window in that case.)
To sum up: with this version, I belive that NaturallySpeaking is good enough for folks who just don't like to type to use.  It is a godsend for those of use with Repetitive Stress Injuries.  It is WONDERFUL to use when transcribing notes or working from items I want to hold in my hands as I type.  I hope that it will continue to improve, even in the light of all the recent mergers and aquisitions.

When I saw that, I wondered how much time was spent correcting dictation.  So, I thought, I would write a review using the program, and not make any corrections, so that those reading the review could see what the program really did.
So this was the results.  With the exception of one of point where I knew I had made a mistake in my use of the dictation commands, this review is being written not only with the program, but without making any corrections, and indeed, without even looking at the screen as I speak.
Of course, in fact, but corrections are made, just do is it is necessary to check for title graphical errors after having written something with the keyboard.  However, so that you can get an idea of the job that the program does before corrections, this is my review.

Quicken is without question the king of personal financial software. It  simply outperforms and out features all the rest. But this abundance of  features is a double edged sword. For the new user of financial software,  it is definitely overwhelming. It requires a good bit of setup to get the  information you want. But for the experienced user, it is  outstanding.
Quicken 2001 Deluxe is extremely versatile. You can track  dozens of checking accounts and credits cards, pay bills electronically,  track your stock portfolio's current value online and have it update your  net worth. It keeps track of your deductible tax expenses and has numerous  pre formatted reports you can use to manipulate the data. Also, all the  reports can be customized to include or exclude certain accounts, payees,  dates, etc. You can also save customized reports that you use  repeatedly.
The feature I like is the snapshot, which gives you updated  graphs and lists, customized by the user, of all the relevant financial  information you want to see at a glance, like net worth, budget  performance, credit outstanding, etc.  The online support site can be  directly accessed from within Quicken, you don't have to open a seperate  browser. I've also had very good luck ordering my checks from  Intuit.
Quicken 2001 continues Intuit's progress on improving the  software.  The interface is more versatile, giving the user more options as  to how to set it up.  The financial reports are good and continue to  improve.  Quickens portfolio tracker is astounding allowing you to download  tons of information on stocks in your portfolio or others you just want to  watch.  If you aren't sure whether to upgrade, I strongly recommend  it.
Overall, I would highly recommend Quicken to any experienced user.  For new or technophobic users with needs for a lot of these features, I  recommend you gut it out and spend some time with Quicken to learn how much  it can do for you.
If your fiancial needs are very simple and you buy a  lot of the ""XXXXX for Dummies"" books, Quicken might be more than  you need or want to take on. Still, it might be worth it to try the  program.

Here a couple things I've noticed while using the program:
- At first I found the interface and all of the features were a bit overwhelming -- there was just a lot of information on each screen.  After reading through the Quick Start guide and playing around with it I got the hang of it.
- Getting your accounts set up can eat up a lot of time, depending on how you choose to do it.  If you don't want to backfill any data then you can get up an running very quickly, but if you want to do any backfill you might find yourself spending a lot of time entering information from old statements an reconciling accounts.  Personally, it took me a couple evening to get the accounts backfilled and set up the way I wanted.
- There is a degree of ongoing maintenance, but no surprise there.  Periodically you need to enter new transactions from all of your accounts.  I've found that some banks limit the transaction history they keep online, so if you fall behind you end up digging through paper statements.
- Getting some of the graphs to give you the ""true picture"" can be difficult.  For example, if you incur a lot of business expenses for which you are later re-imbursed you will find those transactions landing on different months.  This throws off any monthly cash flow analysis you do.  Luckily, Quicken's graphs are pretty configurable so there are work arounds.

I'd even bought a copy (at Costco) and returned it, after reading the complaints.  Then I found one for sale at a computer show at a steep discount, and decided to try it out after all -- AFTER thoroughly backing-up my data.
I'm happy to say that yes, things have gotten slicker, and bigger, but they've also gotten better.  The last release (2000 Deluxe) had some ""features"" that drove me nuts, and these seem to have been addressed (I like to think because of my ... to Intuit's feedback e-mails).  These fixes are enough to justify the upgrade, for me.
Here's a list of what's immediately apparent: The Alt key works properly again.  (Alt-F goes to the file menu.)  There's an easily-customizable toolbar, to which I added things I had to search endlessly for in the past (e.g., how to pay my mortgagees -- scheduled transactions).  There's a ""recategorize"" feature (which I found in the toolbar customizer) that let me fix up some old data in obsolete categories.  (Probably it's been there all along, but I just didn't know about it.  I've had that happen before with Quicken!)  The help has gotten better but still could use some help.  (Example: I'm in a credit card transaction.  What does the Ref field hold?  Hitting F1 doesn't tell me -- I have to do a search to find out.)
Things they still haven't fixed: Making a loan payment still brings up invisible accounts under the ""Choose Loan"" list.  (Obviously nobody at Intuit ever had their mortgage sold or refinanced.  Guess that's what you get when your programmers pay for their houses in cash.)  There are still ads for services, masquerading as Quicken features -- and you can't remove them.  (Example: ""Backup my valuable investment records"".)  I can't seem to find a ""What's new in Quicken 2001"" (there are lists for every previous version, though).
I still approach download of transactions with the greatest of caution, having been burned by this software in the past.  (It downloaded things I did't understand, and created duplicate transactions.  Basically it made a mess.  You have to decide: either enter data manually and reconcile to ensure correctness, or abandon reconciliation and correctness and use Quicken as a computer-based bank statement.)  The situation is perhaps worst with online brokerage accounts.  I haven't tried it yet with this release, to see if there's been an improvement.  When I have a spare couple of evenings, perhaps I'll try it.  Like maybe when I'm retired.  (That's also when I'll explore all those new features they've added.  There must be a cast of hundreds working on this stuff.  Something for everyone?)
In short, it seems like a decent upgrade.  Some annoying problems were fixed.  The database remains rock-solid.  Undoubtedly many worthy features were added.  Are they essential?  (How have you gotten by, up 'til now?)  Would I have bought it for $..., in retrospect?  Sure.  Quicken and I spend a lot of time together.

It also  supports web pages AS desktop, which is a neat new feature expanding on the  Active Desktop theme.

1. Freezing, crashing, lockups, incompatibility, sudden program closures (with data loss) and more blue screens than I can throw at keyboard at (biggest gripe).

My laptop, which I purchased used, is a Compaq Armada 1590DMT (150 mHz) with 80 MB RAM, which came with Windows 98.  I have a 24 gig C drive on the desktop, and only 2 gigs on the laptop.  I upgraded both machines to Windows ME with no problem at the same time.

For some reason, unknown to me, when you go through ""Start"" and ""Shut down"" on the desktop, it never shows the ""It's now safe to turn off your computer"" notice--just a horizontal stripe on a dark screen, but I can tell by the sound that it's finished the cycle. I'm not troubled by the problem.  The laptop does fine.

The one feature which I have learned to like in ME is the ""Restore"" function.  When you do have a system problem, it is relatively easy to restore the machine's system to a previous time, when everything worked.

In fact, when the machine starts in ""Safe"" mode, it automatically takes you to the ""Restore"" function, which you can either accept or reject.  No recently loaded applications or files are lost with restore.  Only the system is restored to an earlier time.

Other than that, there are no significant visual or operating differences between 98 and ME that I can see, and I've run it for three or four months now.

There is one difference in capability, which cost me some money.  I had a French made flatbed SCSI scanner which I liked, and it worked fine with Windows 95.  However, Windows ME does not support SCSI, and so I had to purchase a new Hewlett-Packard scanner which plugs into my parallel port.  (The printer plugs into the scanner.)  Currently I'm having trouble with the scanner operation, but the printer works fine.  I'm going to have to sort that out when I get time.  However, the HP scanner DID work with ME, and I assume I can make it work again.

That's about all the comment I have on ME.  No more complaint than one usually finds with a Microsoft product, and I'm used to the little glitches.  Sometimes I wish I could just go back to DOS, when things were simpler, before Microsoft tried to make things ""user friendly"" and reduced our control in the process.

Windows ME is as good an OS as a regular user can get that is both familiar to them and easy to use.  As for those comments that it ""isn't any different"" from Windows 98, as far as the User Interface is concerned you're absolutly right, there is no difference in how the OS looks, feels, and is used.  That's Microsoft's goal, to have a common user interface.  All of the major OS differences are IN the OS.  Built in drivers, bug fixes, the ability to use more up to date technology, expanded memory capability, security fixes and the like.  All things the user can't see.

Let's start by looking at the plus side.  The new features are pretty nice.  Windows Media Player is much better than its predecessors.  Internet Explorer 5.5 is a great browser and not having to download the beast is an added bonus.  The auto update feature (while somewhat annoying at times) is much easier than searching the web for the latest software updates.  If you feel these features are reason enough to upgrade your to ME, then go for it.
As I said, ME still has plenty of reliability problems.  It is still possible for a single application to bring down the entire operating system.  In my experience it has been rare that I actually get the OS to shut down properly.  I have used Linux and NT for years and gotten used to their stability.  I had forgotten just how bad the stability of this line of operating systems could be.
One word of caution if you are still thinking about making the purchase: pay attention to the system requirements!  I tried installing the upgrade on an old Pentium 133 Mhz system.  The requirements say a minimum of 150 Mhz is needed, but I figured the OS would just run slowly so I went ahead with the install.  After ME partitioned and formatted my hard drive, it told me my system didn't meet the 150 Mhz requirement and exited the installation.

The first was an upgrade from Win-95 two years ago, and I've had little problems with it during that time.  The installation was easy.  Once I learned to stay away from the Active Desktop, and got a reference on setting up some of the maintenance tasks, using it has been easy (scheduling disk maintenance and such).  Since then I've added additional RAM, a CD-R/W, two different printers and several large software packages (such as Front Page and JBuilder) without problems.  I might also note that the upgrade solved several problems I was having with slow modem connections.  Since upgrading to ME I've never had a problem with currupted anything on this machine.
Last weekend I purchased and installed the full version on a second machine.  For the last year I had been struggling with various versions of Linux on it, and after getting REALLY frustrated trying to establish a network connection between the two machines I got mad, ran over to BestBuy and purchased ME.  Within 4 hours of buying it I was file sharing with the other machine.
Now, I'm a programmer by trade, so I don't say it lightly that I was having trouble making Linux work for me as a home OS.  I decided that I was spending far to much time trying to get Linux to work rather than using it to develope software, word processing, installing or upgrading packages and other tasks.  I get paid for that at work.  Windows ME might have its warts, and I wish it would support FrontPage's server features, but for $... you can get a couple of good references for getting around some of the more annoying ones.
If you are using an earlier version of Windows, it is well worth the $... to upgrade.  I  decided NOT to upgrade to or use XP because of some of the many issues surrounding privacy and configuration some people have, which is why this last weekend I purchased the full version of ME instead of XP.
It also helps to make sure you include all the patch updates from the MS web site, again a task made easy to do and automate in ME compared to earlier versions of Windows and just plain confusing in Red Hat Linux (I never knew if what I was 'patching' was anything I really needed or not, where as with ME the package updates are clear to read and understand).","It's not great, but it will do",1058832000,,

To be completely honest, for the first few weeks I was a happy gamer.  I liked all the features ME borrowed from 2000, such as the customizable start menu.  Then I found out that ME removed native DOS mode support and most of my pre-1998 games no longer worked.  Then came the crashes... not once has a day gone by without ME crashing.

Benefits of Windows ME:
1. Faster start-up and shutdown times (at the expense of native DOS mode support)
2. More customizability
3. Much bigger driver database (at the expense of HD space)

CRASH '98 was a lot better than CRASH '95, but only when it was up and running.  '98 had a lot of startup AND shutdown problems.  I downloaded a few patches from Microsoft's site, but nothing helped.  When it was up and running, it did stay up most of the time, even with some serious multi-tasking going on.  It only crashed on me a few times during the year or so I had it.  But the dreaded reboots would get me just about every time, and just about destroy my whole system.
So I upgraded to CRASH Me.  Now I have no more startup problems, but still have stutdown issues.  And I get visited by the friendly blue screen of death again!  It is a multi-tasking nightmare, even with 512 megs of RAM, and even using Microsoft stuff (Access, Excel, etc).

I like Dells, I haven't a thing against them, though ME isn't as great as they wanted it to be.  There's nothing really wrong with my system.  I read several other reviews and found that people probably shouldn't try to Reinstall Me, i've heard several of my IT partners saying that Me doesn't like to be reinstalled.  system restore on ME isn't reliable, i'd use something a little better.  Dell sent along Norton with my PC and it has a ZIP recovery and my HP9900 has a backup feature.  The restore points aren't really that useful in my opinion, even with other programs.
The one problem i will say is that the scandisk and the defrag have never completely worked like they have with other OS.  No matter how you try it, there's always something writing to the disk, changing its contents or even searching the disk that Defrag and Scandisk are constantly restarting.  If you run Scandisk you have to wait until if gives you that 10 or more error and just tell it to ignore, then walk away or go to sleep for the night, wake up and see how its doing.  The surface scan in Windows Me doesn't work at all for me, in 98/se it will but not well... but at least in 98/Se there was a way to use the DOS version of Scandisk surface scan... Only after shuttinsdown Explorer from TaskManager did i find Scandisk on standard... Dos isn't there anyways.

I wouldn't suggest upgrading or really buying ME unless you just want to.  If you have plenty of money and really don't care then hey go for it... the My Pictures folder and the Thumbnail View option are pretty nifty, and the homenetworking wizard works... kinda.  One major problem is that ME is not a 98/third edition... it's more like WIN2000 for the home, watered down version and so many products are not ME compatible or ME stable.

At first I was very excited about a new intergrated with Windows ME help option. HOWEVER I was extremely fustrated with it. I completely dislike the intergration with the Microsoft Passport option, with the logging in. I am also more fustrated with the option itself.
I have tried around sixteen times to submit a report, and it consistently freezes my brand new 850Mhz PIII w/384MB of RAM PC. It freezes to the point of totally crashing my system and re-booting, or CTRL+ALT+DELETE to close it down. The Help section itself needs help only with the online surpport portion. The offline support option is very convienent and well made.

4743,3,FALSE,"09 26, 2000",A3D8D25M8HSQAX,B00004W62O,,John B,"Ok where to begin with Microsoft's newest P.O.S.? I had the chance to start running Microsoft Windows Me a few months ago, and I jumped at the shot. I was really happy to finally get a new OS on my machine.
  Let me begin by letting everyone know what I am running now. I have a custom built machine, by myself. It is a Cerleron 566 overclocked to 850Mhz on an Abit Rev. II motherboard, 128mb RAM, 100 gigs of Hard drive space, Road Runner cable (not so) high speed internet access, Turtle Beach: Santa Cruz soundcard and a Matrox G200 Mystique 8mb video card.
  Ok I'll put it this way, Microsoft's Windows ME does not let me use my computer to its best of performance capabilites. Win Me is slow and it looks like a direct rip off of Windows 2000. Well not that, that is a bad thing, Win 2k is at least a stable operating system that is powerful (to say the least).
  Windows ME just runs about as fast as a turtle, and it is system resource hungry. I constantly have to restart whenever I do any multitasking. When there are multiple web browsers open, you can kiss half of your resources good bye. I have a lot of .dll (dynamic library link) failures when I multitask and my system just runs terrible. Once most of your memory is used up, if you don't restart... Then your internet speed will cut in half and folders take their time to open. I was also not a big fan with the networking capabilities on WIN ME. It almost looks as if Microsoft took Windows 98 ripped out have of the networking abilities and then threw WIN 2k icons on top of it, therefor creating Windows ME.
  To put it nicely, I am really dissapointed with this OS. I was overall impressed with Windows 98 Second Edition and I still prefer it now. But to tell you the truth, I was really excited when I heard Microsoft was releasing WIN ME. I had a lot of high hopes that were really let down. I don't even know what went wrong, but Microsoft really screwed this one up!
  I hate WIN Me and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. But, I will let you know that there are a few good points to it and I can see how others might enjoy it. WIN ME is very easy to navigate and very user friendly. There are a bunch of new options in Windows Media Player, which I'm sure a lot of people will like (although, I dislike Media Player myself). The overall appearence to Millenium is nicer. I really enjoy the look of it, as opposed to the old 98 and 95 series. What do I mean by that? I mean the desktop and menues. It is set up a bit nicer and the new icons look more upbeat. Although they are nothing new, everything came from Windows 2000. Oh yeah, try and restart in MS DOS Mode, you can't... Because it's not there! Microsoft decided to leave DOS out of WIN ME, except for the DOS prompt inside Windows. But overall, there is just nothing in Win Me to keep me running it. It took me a month or so to make my decision to go back to WIN 98 SE on a dual boot with Mandrake Linux 7.1
  My recomendations are to either stick with Windows 98 Second Edition or with Windows 2000. If you are looking for a fast OS with stability, it is best to stay away from Win ME. If you have it in ya, learn Linux... Linux is fast, powerful, stable and fun once you get into it. But do your self a favor, stay away from Microsofts newest operating system Windows ME - Millenium Edition, or try it out first to decide for yourself. I didn't care for it in the least bit. I would give it 1 star, but I know it doesn't really deserve that. Hey, at least it runs... Thats about all I could ask from it. But the truth is, WIN ME just plain sucks. There isn't much to it that I like, I would probably never go back to it and most of my friends feel the same way. Actually, just about everyone I have talked to, who hava ran Windows ME disliked it. Read what other people have wrote. Most of them dislike it too! Honestly, I'd stay away!
  I hope I gave some of you a bit of information that is useful. I'm not trying to bash Microsoft because they are the industry standard, because I'm not. I just wanted to provide you all with my point of view about the way I feel and my experiences with their new program. I am awaiting the next version of WIN ME (whatever they'll call it). I'd be more than happy to run it too. Plain and simple; I didn't care for WIN ME and I wanted everyone to know where I stand =) Hope that did it for ya! And if you really want to, try it at risk!",3 stars is probably a bit too generous!!!,969926400,14,

I uninstalled the card, re-installed it and then installed the drivers again, and my sound worked. I restarted the computer, and my sound stopped working again. I uninstalled ME after that, not wanting to deal with the problem that should be a very smooth transition. I also had a few problems with networking as I could not connect to things I previously could with ease. The majority of the programs it installed were programs I could download for free off the net.

First all there isn't anything exclusive, besides the Windows Movie Maker. This software isn't that great. The video quality is so terrible. You can only save in Windows Media Format, not a plus for your friends that only use Real Player or Quicktime. And the choices for video quality is extemely limited. Unlike most video software, you canNOT choose the quality to crisp. It has high, medium and low. Low looks terrible, medium looks ok and high looks fair.
It's mainly intended for emailing these clips. Sometimes I like to make video clips, burn them to a CD/Zip disk and send to friends that way to preserve quality and sound. I also prefer Real Player files, over Windows Media.
The System Restore feature isn't all it's cracked up to be: It only does around 1-2 entries every few days. It's not very effective/reliable. For example with WildFile's GoBack(TM), you can easily go to virtually any day/time in your history log and restore your PC to exactly the way it was. If your PC was not running, then at start-up it has a restore option whereas on Windows System Restore, it's limited to two or three entries every few days, and it only works as long as Windows does.
The ""new and improved"" My Pictures is pretty nice. It lets you thumbnail your photo's without having to click them to see them. You can preview them now. Boot-up and shut-down times on my pc are extremely quicker than Windows 98 SE. I have a 850Mhz PIII w/384MB of RAM.
Finally, MSIE 5.5, Outlook 5.5, MSN Messenger 3.01, and Windows Media Player 7.0: Are all FREE downlaods from Windows Update. And don't let these features pursuade you to Windows Me.

Well, they don't happen with newer versions of Windows  (because applications are forced to run in their own protected memory  space, and can't corrupt the other applications, because the OS (Operating  System) prevents them from destroying each other.)  But now Microsoft is  increasingly integrating IE (Internet Explorer) into the OS.  Likewise,  it's integrating Office into the OS.  So bugs in IE or Office often cause  the whole OS to act up, and force a complete reboot.  For example, when I  click on a link in an email in Outlook, IE, Outlook, and the OS and  whatever other applications I'm running freeze up until I kill IE.  I've  reinstalled IE and Office, but it doesn't help.  This happened when I  upgraded my Win 98/2000 IE5.0 dual boot system.

Why would you buy a product that  provides you with everything that is FREE off of windows update?

Windows 2000 plays all the games I have ever tried on it: even old  DOS-mode games like Masters of Magic, Doom, and Masters of Orion.
Windows 2000 is based on the NT kernel, thus is more stable than  Win9x/ME which is still based on the DOS kernel.

There are a few things I don't like about this program and the worst in my opinion is the cloning tool.  Once you position the marker and begin to clone, it becomes very difficult at times to see where you're cloning from because the marker tends to vanish and you can lose track of where it is.  Picture It 2000 had the same problem.  The other negative is that there aren't a lot of ""special"" effects in here.  Again, just like Picture It 2000.
Aside from the minor quirks, PI Platinum 2001 is pretty decent.  I do photography professionally, so I use Photoshop 5.5 and U-Lead Photo Impact for most of my work, but for quick e-mailing and general puttzing around, a program like this or Photo Deluxe 4.0 is a must.
Finally, and I said the same thing in the review I did on Photo Deluxe 4.0, ULead Photo Impact gives you so much more and it's not a difficult program to use. But if you want an all-encompassing program where you can edit your pictures, create countless cards, calendars, stationery, and just about anything else, plus easy and quick e-mailing and web posting, you can't beat Picture It Publishing Platinum 2001.",Great For The Beginner,969926400,75,

I have been creating lots of printed photos from my travels and family gatherings. And everyone loves the neat frames (borders) around them. I share them with friends and use magnets to hold lots of them on my refrigerator.
You can create your own custom calendars easily also. So many great photo projects. And of course you can do great greeting cards, too. I create half-fold cards on glossy greeting card paper and people can't tell I printed them myself at home (HP P1100). I print a small for-keeps self-photo on the back of the card as a nice ""extra."" It prints on the glossy side; so they get a nice personalized greeting card and a picture they can keep if they want to cut it out before disposing of the card.
The software walks you through the steps necessary to create/customize nice results. You can create excellent output for printing, for sharing by email, for posting to a web site, and even for sending to an online photo-printing service.
I feel I got more than my money's worth with this product.... especially after the $15 rebate, and with the great pack of sample papers included in the box.
There are about 10 cd's with this software. But not all of it is installed to the hard-drive during installation. When you select certain items from the ""catalog"" (index), you can see which cd it is on before you select it. I find that I use artwork from cd #2 a lot. So I copied the contents of that CD to my hard-drive. (When the software asks you to insert a particular CD, you can click ""options"" and specify a different location where it should look for the CD.) And you can download additional clip-art and projects from the internet...many for free.
You can also use picture-it to catalog your photos - - even if they are on removable media (cd's, zip disks, etc.). It can create multimedia gretting cards.
I didn't expect great things from this software because of the low price and the $15 rebate; but I definitely got a lot more than I ever imagined. And I've only had it 3 days!  It's just what I needed.

Eventually I successfully created a Rescue Disk set but it would not boot my system.  Subsequently, at random intervals, I created and tested four or five new Rescue Disk sets but none has ever rebooted my system.
 Twice, after the product optimized my registry and proceeded with an automatic shutdown, the shutdown process ""hung"" and I had to hit my computer's Reset button.  That step caused new registry errors.  While NU2001 fixed the new errors easily, this extra repair step wastes time.  I am becoming less and less tolerant of the time it wastes.
 The Anti-Virus function appears to work fine but some of its on-screen prompts are imprecise or otherwise inadequate.  Its automatic on-line anti-virus updating process also seems to work properly but the download function's on-screen prompts are puzzling --  I think they are either counter-intuitive or they require too much decision-making on arcane technical points -- or a needed (helpful) prompt is conspicuous by its absence.
 While most of the product's on-screen prompts are at least good, I found some to be vague or too complicated.  Other prompts seemed poorly written (programmer-ese?).  Still other on-screen layouts and prompts seemed to me like they'd been chosen for their ""beauty"" rather than for their functionality.
 The rebate form seems confusing to me, almost as if it had been deliberately written this way to discourage customers from filling it out and mailing it in.
 Since I've done some programming myself, I can empathize with programmers who may be pressured my management to quickly complete a project to satisfy marketing or other business demands.  However, that pressure on programmers can and often does result in problems for customers who use the product.  I suspect that at Norton/Symantec there are two camps: One camp wants to do ship only the best possible overall program design, one with only professionally-written on-screen prompts, a product optimized for ease of use by non-technical customers.  The other camp wants to just get the package out the door and into the market, period, and doesn't care about how much trouble customers might have using the product -- this might be called the ""Grab the money and run"" camp.  With NU2001, I suspect both camps may have influenced the product's creation.  So while you should have some very satisfying moments with this product, also prepare for at least a little frustration.
 In conclusion, I think this product is a good investment.  It does several valuable things, it does them well, it does them efficiently, and it does most of them without excessive demand for technical understanding or other interaction by the user.  In spite of several flaws, I think Norton Utilities 2001 can be a valuable resource for the most casual computer user as well as professionals.  I'm very glad it is available, I'm equally glad I bought it, and I have no qualms about recommending it to others.
P.S.  Attention Norton/Symantic management: I'd gladly pay for a NU2001 upgrade (overhaul!) which uses _only_ prompts incorporated into _intuitive_ on-screen layouts, and which are written by _only_ professional writers, and which use _only_ non-technical language.  I respectfully submit that the people who wrote the NU2001 manual might be your best guide in this regard.",Functionally superior but klunky in some ways.,972086400,36,

As for features offered, the program gets five stars in my book.  The problem is that Merriam-Webster has apparently taken their Windows version of the program, with all of the clunky, non-intuitive interfacing that goes with that platform, and simply ""tweaked"" the code to make it work on a Mac.
A few examples:
1. Once you've searched for a word, you have to double-click in the entry box and delete the first word before you can begin typing a new search word--whereas Mac standards dictate that you'd simply Tab back to the field to select all and start again.
2. There's no hot key to toggle between the Dictionary and Thesaurus searches, or between the Basic Search, Advanced Search, and Browse functions--you have to choose these features with pop-up menus and tab buttons.
3. When you launch the application, it opens a window that is pre-configured for a 17"" monitor.  No problem on my desktop G3--but on my iBook the window is partially off the screen, so I have to shift the window manually to see all of it.  Furthermore, though the window frame resizes, the CONTENTS of the window do NOT resize--and there are no scroll bars to see information that may be hidden if you shrink the window too far.  (NOTE: the window does fit--just barely--on an iBook's 12.1"" screen.)
Small problems, to be sure, but for a resource that's primarily used ""on the fly"" while working on other projects, anything that slows me down is frustrating.  Still, I do use M-W daily, so I do consider its purchase price money well spent.","Well, it does WORK on a Mac...",984787200,53,

It's a lot like Clue, except instead of being bored and rolling a dice you answer interesting questions ranging from simple (Where is Grand Central Station?) to incredibly hard (Which state has the date Dec. 7, 1787 on it?). Just like Clue, also, you make an ""accusation"" on a crook but it makes it a lot more interesting when limitations are put on how many warrants can be out. The gameplay itself is a little confusing at first but only takes a little while to get used to and can easily be spiced up with more personal rules to make it more challenging.

It really makes you think about places and cities in the US... and it's great that the game board is a huge map to help you if you can't figure out the answer right off the bat. Even though this has harder questions to it, it's still a good game for kids, too, because in the end everyone's a ""winner"" trying to help find Carmen by putting all the state capitals in their correct states, which was fun to do as a group instead of someone being sour about losing.

Overall this game was a LOT of fun to pick up and play on a whim, and you really learn a lot. Might be a cool game to take to a geography or U.S. History study group to play as a break.","Lots of fun, and very educational!",1374019200,,

As she also comes from a family of board game players, I correctly guessed both that she had never seen this board game like myself, and that she would love it because she is such a fan of the series; she was quite excited to receive it as a gift.

We played it once on Christmas night, and it was a lot of fun. There are a lot of questions that really bring back some of the simple ideas of geography, like state capitols.  The game requires that one must successfully answer a question before being able to proceed, and each question comes with a multiple choice option in case the person answering has no idea; by using the multiple choice option, you cannot travel as far as answering the question without multiple choice ""assistance.""  This goes on as people discover different cards in a similar manner to Clue where one must uncover all three cards that go together, and then make a guess about where Carmen Sandiego is hiding.

In addition to the multiple choice assistance, there is also help sitting on the board itself.  The states have many of their more recognizable cities, and all capitols, printed onto them.  This leads to a fun after-game, where a secondary game gives each player a set of tokens that have a state capitol on them.  All players must place their tokens on the appropriate state within a preset amount of time, which depends on the number of people playing, or ""Carmen Sandiego escapes.""

This game was fun to play, and it was refreshing to get the learning aspect of it as well.  As a result, I suspect this would go well with children learning geography.

Don't get me wrong, Adobe Photoshop is the Granddaddy of them all and a beautiful program, but there's a big learning curve and the need for some deep pockets.

Now 6.0 is what I use the most even over Photoshop.  The program is much easier to use, it's loaded with palletes and effects, and the album feature is a Godsend.

The only real difference between them all is the relocation of some of the functions.  Basically, the programs all work the same.  There are some additions to 6.0 that you'll have to learn on your own because they aren't in this 4.2 book.  By the way, the book is called ""Fun with PhotoImpact 4.2"" and was written by Stephanie Baker-Thomas.  I got a copy from Amazon.com.  There is an excellent book for PhotoImpact 6.0 called ""PhotoImpact Solutions"" and can be ordered directly from Muskel & Lipman publishing.
Although I do photography professionally, I still like to forget that now and then and have fun with my pictures as well, and for that, PhotoImpact 6.0 comes with Uleads ""Drop Spot"" which puts an icon on your desktop which will then connect you to imira.com which is Uleads site for you to put you pictures on the web for all to see.

However, after ordering this software I am starting to think that I may actually be able to learn French.

As a little background I have never been good at languages and I was not very good at my foreign languages in school (could barely speak a word).  I am an absolute beginner at French an was very nervous that my past performance in learning languages would prevent me from learning French.  I was also a little nervous when I read some of the other reviews that said this might not be the best program for beginners, but I ordered it in the hopes that I could at least try something new.

I am extremely happy with my purchase.  The proram walks you through French in a very intuitive manner, and though there aren't any explanations it starts you out so slowly that you are easily able to figure out the meanings of what you are seeing on the screen.  There is something to be said for learning a language by recognition and repetition rather than learning the grammer rules first.  I do use my grammer book occasionally (I bought it before this) but only to satisfy my curiosity about certain thins like feminine and masculine articles, and singular and plural nouns...

Honestly this is a fantastic program that teaches you how to speak and hear French with amazing success.  You do learn the grammer rules, but you figure them out for yourself by comparing phrases and by building on earlier lessons.  It really is similar to the way a child learns to talk (without ever having to know what a past participle is).  Bottom line - fantastic proram and I would have no problems suggeting it to anyone.

Nothing is translated; all meanings are conveyed by a clever use of pictures.  You see a french expression, hear it spoken, and see its meaning illustrated, all at the same time.  The method works.  It allows the English compartment of the mind to quiet down and the French to take over.  I felt that I was absorbing french vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence patterns more efficiently with this program than by any other learning method I have tried.
  For the most part the pictures make the meanings obvious, but when they don't you are on your own.  I kept Google running in the background and used its translation facility to look up the occasional mysterious word.  That usually worked, but the lack of English translations within the program is a design flaw in my opinion.  Doubtless they would protest that including translations would go against the spirit of total immersion.  Well, having to stop to look things up in a french-english dictionary is not total immersion either.  But this flaw is not fatal.

So much for any piece of language software, but now after moving through the program, I see just how powerful the technique is. ... ... The Rosetta Stone software is much different, they guarantee your unconditional success, and if you don't achieve it, you return the software. That was enough to sell me. Also, if you need more proof, it's the same software the U.S. State department uses, as well as many other language schools throughout the world, with great customer service.
 The most unique and most baffling aspect of the program is the fact that there's no grammar. For most who have tried venturing into a new language, doing so without grammar seems way too good to be true, but I'm living proof, it does work. More times than not, I felt frustrated that no translation was provided, but this forced me to pay attention more to the slight differences, and I think helped me pick up the language quicker. I used to think that was a terrible idea, it was indeed very frustrating, but since there's only four pictures to choose from, it won't take too much time for you to figure things out, repetition it a must, and your new vocabulary will stay with you for a long time. Also a plus, the program is simple to use, and very basic, no reading a long technical manual here.  Recommend
 As you can see, I strongly believe the program excels on all levels, but now, on to the things that weren't so great. The lack of a grammar book of some sort could be a major set back for those who get frustrated easily. Like I said before, the program is very simple and easy to use. This is also a drawback, yes, I like being able to understand the interface but, where were the sides games, I felt like the program was missing something in that area. Also, I feel the whole issue about the pronunciation meter is a little strange. In this program, you can talk to it through a microphone and it will tell you how fluent you sound. Seems fair enough but, there are many different ways to pronounce Spanish. There's the way they speak in Spain, in Latin America, (Mexico standing out as well) and different in southern America. The differences sometimes might seem subtle, but why not have the program address this with different speakers for different regions? Also, as a male, I found it difficult to pronounce words like the female orator. I don't know why they didn't record a male and a female version from which I could choose for everything.
 This program is wonderful, with its minor faults. The most important thing I could say is, it is the best you'll find out there for now. No book, tutor, or [less expensive] software even comes close. I advise you buy the software and dedicate yourself to it for at least 30 minutes for ten days. The more you put into it, the more you will get out. If at that point you feel it's not working, send it back. I promise you'll be glad you tried it. I hope you achieve your language learning goals. ...","For anyone learning Spanish, this program is a must.",1032652800,236,

(I have previously studied French, Latin, and ancient Greek.)  I ordered it from the company directly but returned it after about a month.  It has some interesting unique features but it was not for me.

Here are the positives:

1.  The pictures are colorful and memorable and will help you learn many words quickly.

2.  There is an interesting effective feature which allows you to listen to a word or phrase in Spanish, record your voice, and playback.  Then a scale tells you how close your voice came to that of a native speaker.  But I would not spend extensive time repeating the same word or phrase because it is very difficult to meet their standard for ""native speaker.""

These are the negatives:

1.  There is a great emphasis on sentences that are not practical for an adult tourist, business person, or employee wanting to speak Spanish with native speakers.  In addition, most of the sentences have verbs in the present progressive tense; there is not enough practice in all the Spanish verb tenses. There are many sentences in Spanish about boys under the table, girls walking, women waving, and men falling.

2.  Because I work at a computer all day at work, I am not motiviated to sit at a computer for long during my spare time.

Because I am eager to learn useful Spanish quickly, Pimsleur is more effective for me.  I can listen to the CDs in my car or at home.  In addition, I have learned more sentences that I may want to use such as how to find a bathroom, restaurant, or pharmacy; or how to order food.

Most of it is really impractical, unlike the Pimsleur CDs which I really like. For example, Rosetta will teach you early on ""The boy is running. The horse is eating a carrot"" while Pimsleur prefers things like ""I want to drink a beer. How much is it?"" for early lessons.  As you can see, the practicality of the latter far exceeds that of the former. Proably because Pimsleur focuses on statements involving ""I"" and ""You"" instead of the 3rd person.

The present progressive tense indicates that the action is in progress right now, e.g. I am eating (now), He is jumping (now). In Spanish the present progressive tense is quite restricted and is usually limited to what a person is doing RIGHT NOW.  The present progressive is formed by conjuagting the appropriate ending of one verb,the verb estar, and adding the gerund of the appropritate verb. Some examples from the course might be: Los muchachos estn saltando (The boys are jumping (right now); El nio est corriendo, (The boy is running) etc. It's kind of like the old Dick and Jane stuff. The point is, you get a lot of work with the verb ""estar"" and a lot of work with the gerund (the ""ing"" form )of other verbs, but little else. This is a cop out and it is not the way people speak.

The present indicative is much more versatile tense and is the most commonly used tense in the spanish language (The present progressive, on the other hand, is little used).  The present indicative can be used just like the present progressive, it can be used to express the future (e.g. Voy maana, I'm leaving tomorrow), it can be used to express a polite command (e.g. Me trae un cafe, por favor--bring me a coffee, please. In most instances this simple command form is considered much more polite than using the imperative mood (Me trae...is all you'll ever need in a restaurant). The present indicative tense refers to the specific now (as does the present progressive), but it also refers to the general now (these days, this time period, e.g., I live in the U.S.; I'm going to the store, I'm studying Spanish (This is a good example that shows clearly what I'm talking about--I'm studying Spanish now, yesterday and tomorrow--an ongoing ""studying"" of Spanish--Estudio espaol (present indicative) as opposed to estoy estudiando espaol--I've got the book open in front of me and that's what I'm doing at this very moment.

With this program you learn the endings to the verb estar, learn the gerund of a couple hundred verbs and bingo, you're talking spanish. It's easy--no learning all those separate endings for all those verbs, no learning irregular verbs, etc.  The problem is, it ain't the way people talk.  This is such an egregious error, it's so impractical, that I'm surprised they continue to sell the program without correcting the problem.

  Why did I start shopping for this product? Before I left on my trip, I had a hard time deciding if it would be worth the $350 to get the Europe MapSource. In addition to stops in the UK and Spain, we were scheduled to visit somewhere in Africa, too. We would only be in each country for a couple of weeks, so I didn't think it would be worth spending the money on the European MapSource.

  Why did I end up buying this product? As a compromise, I thought this World Map (I bought version 3.02) would at least give me the base map and major roads and highways. My expectation was that it would not have anywhere near as much data or detail in it as the North America MapSource, but I expected what data it DID have would be ACCURATE. Boy was I wrong.

  Where and how long did I spend evaluating this product overseas? I spent one week in England, driving to and from London and Plymouth. I spent three weeks in Rota, Spain (near Cadiz / southwest of Seville). Our trip to Africa was canceled, so we got to spend a glorious week in Lisbon, Portugal instead.

  What were my observations about this World Map? As I stated before, I expected that the things that were in there would at least be plotted correctly / accurately. I expected that with the GPS at least showing me where I was in relation to major landmarks and holding a paper map in my hand, I would be able to have a general feel for where I was on the paper map. It was not so.

  In the places I visited (UK, Spain, Portugal), it was extremely inaccurate. For example, I would be a quarter mile on the NW side of the Thames river, and it would show me as being a quarter mile SE of the Thames river.

  The major highways it does show are not labeled the same as they are labeled when you are driving around. This was particularly frustrating in Spain. I would try finding street signs that would lead me to a major highway labeled as one thing on the GPS, but I would never find any signs with the same label as on the GPS, because they use totally different names.

  In summary, the geographic positions of what is included in this world map are significantly off and inaccurate, and the labels on the major highways don't match the actual names on the highways in the UK, Spain, and Portugal.

The maps I thought were of decent quality, and included some nicities I didn't necessarily expect, like more detailed roadways than the base map my Garmin GPS came with.  It's abilities to send data to and from the GPS, along with what could be done with that data, were sufficient and useful.  All in all, a very useful product.

However, despite it's advantages, I encountered numerous problems during the installation and while trying to use it.  For starters, the user manual is almost useless when it comes to installation.  It was written in a somewhat vague and imcomplete way in an attempt to cover the installation steps for multiple different MapSource products.  During initial install, it wanted to check for the GPS, but it could not find it, prompting me to select a serial COM port, despite that I was using a USB connection.  However, once installed, it saw the GPS without any problems.  It also did not appear to have any custom installation options.  Only ""Typical Installation"" was available as an option during the install.  The maps are stored on 3 separate disks that were not copied to the hard drive as I would have liked.  When I switch between east or west US, I am forced to switch disks.  I assume there is a way to fully install the maps to the hard drive, but I have yet to figure it out.  I would have expected it to be part of a ""Custom Installation"" option that it didn't seem to have.

Installed, If I attempt to use the Unlock Maps feature, it results in an error saying that it couldn't start the UnlockWizard and suggesting a reinstall of the application.  And the grand daddy of errors that you should never see in a product, selecting ""Check for Updates"" from the Help menu results in a fatal error.

Finally, the product seperation and versioning is confusing.  It is difficult to tell what parts of the software are from USA Topo versus what parts are from other installed MapSource pieces, as they all get blurred into one.  This also makes the versions confusing, as looking at the version in the Help menu shows a different version than what is seen on the software packaging.

All of these problems make me very wary of what would otherwise be a fine product.  If they can refine it to where it is more user friendly and error free, I would recommend it.

The limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.

It shows trails, streams, lakes, and other details not available in the city maps, along with elevation contours that give you a pretty good idea whether you'll be climbing up or down along the trail.  So far I've been hiking in two national parks and several local forests, and detail has been adequate.  All lakes and significant streams were on the map.  The hiking trails in the national parks have been marked and matched the paper USGS topo maps we carried.

Some people complain that the maps are old, that they don't show recent roads, etc.  If you want roads, use Garmin City Navigator, which is much more up to date and provides information for routing if your GPS supports it.  The topo maps show mountains and streams that don't change very often (I suppose if you're hiking near Mount St. Helens you might want something more recent!)  They can only be updated as frequently as the USGS does their surveys.  I agree it would be nice if it showed all roads up to date, but it's hardly an issue for hikers.

The elevation markings are in weird increments such as 5039 feet rather than a round 5000 feet.  This makes it a bit clumsy to estimate the height of a point on the map.

The routes are from an old Harrisburg Bicycle Club book from the `70s.  First I map out the key waypoints in the City Navigator Maps and then I select all of them and convert them to a route.  I switch to the MapSource Topo map and select profile and I get a pretty good estimate of the road terrain, which helps me to gauge the high points during the trips.  The only minor drawbacks with the software and I believe the problem lies in the main MapSource program, not the particular maps themselves is that when a profile is created you can not save it as an image.  You have to use the ALT+PrintScreen button to save the results into a paint program.  Also the waypoints appear on the profile as markers, but they are not tagged to match the actual waypoint names.  When I am in the paint program I usually type them in vertically.

I solo hike in national forests, and I thought that if Garmin's maps provided any additional information whatever, then it might be worth the $79 I paid for it.  I should have known better.  This product is absolutely worthless as far as my needs and interests go.  It would take a very long time to enumerate all of the product's many flaws, so here's a very short list.  The documentation and help files are atrocious.  They don't even provide clear information about how to transfer map data to the GPS.  The CD ROM (on which the maps reside) must be inserted in your computer whenever you use MapSource, which means there'll be plenty of unnecessary wear and tear on your CD ROM drive.  That's right!  Proving that they are truly dunderheads of staggering proportions, Garmin's ""genius engineers"" won't even let you copy these maps to your harddrive...no matter how big it is!!!  And once map data are transferred to the GPS, I have found them to be unhelpful and inaccurate.  For instance, two water holes shown on the map are mislocated by several miles.

Is this a GPS problem, a map problem, some combination problem?  I DON'T care, because both products were made by Garmin...so Garmin owns the problems!  Once again Garmin's resident geniuses used an appallingly stupid strategy that reflects a total failure to understand who their customers are and what they're trying to do.  For example, when I zoom into get a close look at my location, various forest service roads are sometimes displayed.  I'd like to see where they go, naturally, so I zoom out a bit to get a better view of them.  WHAM!  They suddenly vanish completely from the display!  Yep, they are not displayed at all.  Instead of seeing them, the screen is crowded with the names of landmarks that are many miles from my location and that have no relevance to what I'm trying to do.  My frustrating experiences have led me to conclude that the GPS/map market is dominated by little-league, back-water, third-rate players like Garmin and DeLorme.  I have had extensive experience with some of their products, and I have always found them to be totally unacceptable.  I hope and pray that a major league player...like Google, Apple, or even Microsoft...will some day take an interest in this market and crush the losers who currently occupy it.  Think about it:  a Google cell phone with integrated GPS and the ability to download highly detailed topo maps (and related internet data) in real time!  WOW!  Can't wait for that to happen.

Relying simply on a sensitive piece of electronic equipment without a good map and compass in the backcountry is not a well-advised decision.  (""Whoops!  Shouldn't have dropped my GPS on those rocks.""  ""Darn!  Coulda sworn I packed extra batteries!""  You get the picture.)

That said, I've found it to be an excellent supplement to 1:24,000 paper maps.  The detail is surprisingly good; I recently completed a section of the Continental Divide Trail in Colorado and found most (but not all) of the trail information from the 7.5' maps on the GPS map.  It's nice to be able to instantly correlate your position between the GPS and a paper map, and the contour lines simply make it easier to visualize your position.  It also shows points of interest like small lakes and rivers, and even old mines and such.  The contour lines do not always perfectly jive up with higher-detail maps, but are close enough.  There does seem to be a problem with not enough contour lines at higher magnifications, so you won't want to zoom in too close if you want to see the lay of the land on your unit.  Position accuracy, however, was very good and appeared just about spot-on with my paper maps.

Installation is easy and the data meshes seamlessly with other MapSource products (well, City Select, anyway, which is the other MapSource product I currently own).  My Garmin GPS60CS holds a tremendous amount of topographical information in its 64 MB internal memory; I fit in almost the entire west half of Colorado plus City Select info for numerous cities between Colorado and Michigan.

One big downside to having so much information loaded is that map-drawing times are achingly slow on my unit, especially if detail is set on Most and Declutter is set to Off.  I found that by unselecting topo information for areas I didn't need, drawing times were improved substantially, though still a bit irritating.  Scrolling to a new area and waiting for the map to catch up can be tedious.  I usually leave Declutter on unless I need a particular detail in an area.

I did not have the opportunity (or the need) to map routes using this software.  I have done so with City Select and found it simple and effective, but don't know how this will translate into Topo.  I've heard and read that the National Geographic maps are better for route mapping, but your results may vary.  I suspect that this is due in large part to the fact that NatGeo maps are 1:24,000 in detail, much higher than USA Topo, so errors will naturally be smaller.  Thus far I have not needed to map routes, as I rely on my map and compass more than my electronics for detailed positioning (and my pencil never runs out of batteries), with my GPS as a verification device.  I can see where this would be an issue, however, if you do a lot of off-trail exploring or otherwise have the need for a detailed, precise route through tricky country.

Value-wise I'd say USA Topo qualifies as very good, particularly in light of the fact that Garmin tends to nickel-and-dime you to death with all of their maps and accessories.  However, you can get USA Topo online for 75 or 80 bucks, and that includes topo information for all 50 states.

My conclusion is that as an advanced, standalone navigation tool for backcountry climing, canyoneering, and other off-trail stuff, USA Topo is a poor choice.  It's fine for trail-hikers and those that don't go bushwhacking, but still no replacement for a good 1:24,000 paper map.  However, if you use it as a supplemental tool and recognize its limitations, it's just dandy.",A Good Companion for Paper Topo Maps,1124755200,35,

This is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your Garmin unit, other software claims to work with your Garmin GPS, but they only download/upload waypoints. This software is way overpriced; it runs off the CD-ROM so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps. I tried copying the CD's to my drive and installing from there and it would not work. When pulling waypoints/routes/tracks from the GPS unit Mapsource always opens up a new map document, you can't import into the map you have open without copying and pasting. This is probably the most overpriced, counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since MS Office. What this all boils down to is if you need detailed TOPO maps for your Garmin unit you'll have to shell out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software.",Mediocre Mapping,1124668800,10,
4998,4,FALSE,"07 2, 2005",A3UO195ZCOA59U,B00004Z0C8,,Aaron D. Chacon,"I break up my review into several phases:

a) Decision to buy.  I find that the Garmin map software has compatibility issues in that only some maps will work well with some GPS units.  Check the Garmin web site to ensure that this software will work on your GSP unit.  Also check out the screen shots.  In my area (San Jose) several major freeways are missing from Topo, indicating that the maps are 10-15 years out of date.  When I contacted Garmin, their response is if you want roads then buy the MetroGuide or CitySelect (as appropriate to your GPS unit) and MetroGuide has the freeways.  I guess that contours don't change much in 10-15 years so that's OK.  But get street maps if you want streets.
  Also, Topo does not support routing on the streets.  MetroGuide does (on the PC only).  CitySelect supports autorouting on some GPS units.  If you are thinking of upgrading your GPS unit in the near future check that the map will work with the upgrade candidates.

b) Installation.  I installed this over the MapSource MetroGuide North America.  The manual is exactly the same as the MetroGuide, and as the CitySelect.  Since there seems to be three generations of change of functionality between the different maps, the manual is not terribly helpful.  And the default Topo installation - direct from CD - wants to have the CD in the drive whenever you use it.  MetroGuide does not have this problem.  The solution (as mentioned in other reviews) is to copy everything to the hard drive and install it from there.  Once that is done the installation is painless (following the on screen instructions).  Although in my case MapSource was not re-installed, all that happened was that the new maps were made available to the existing software, so it was easier for me that it will be for beginners.
  As a side note, I upgraded MapSource from the Garmin web site, and now it writes data files in a format incompatible with the un-upgraded software on the MetroGuide CD.  So rebuilding from CD on my PC to recover from a failure will not allow me to read my existing files.

c) Use on the PC.  I found the software pretty straight forward to use, although I did not use the manual literally since many of the features described I do not have.  The On-line help works and guessing seems to work also.
  On thing that annoyed me is that the countor lines are at even meter intervals (e.g., 500 meters).  If you change your preferences to feet the same countour lines are re-labeled in feet (e.g., 1604 feet)  Since the contour intervals are now some perverse number of feet, and the labeled contour lines are of preverse numbers of feet, interpolating the contours to get the elevation in feet requires a pencil and paper or a calculator.  Or you can change the setup to label in meters (and do it in you head) and then convert to feet on a calculator.  It probably was impractical to have both feet and meter contours.  Or maybe not, the files are not that large (about 1/10 the size of the MetroGuide files).
  Another annoyance (as mentioned elsewhere) is that the maps were pretty much joined by a cut and paste operation.  Sreets, and contour lines jump at the boundaries.

d) Use on the GPS unit.  My unit is a eTrek Vista (the B/W version)  So I find that it is sometimes hard to tell my route from the roads (when following roads).  Due to the screen size and the B/W nature of the unit, I believe that the level of detail is about right for hiking.  If you blow up the screen enough to need more detail the area covered is too small to be useful.  If you want more detail over large areas, you will need paper maps.  You can also control the amount of detail displayed.  I do notice some disagreements between the GPS altitudes measured by my Vista (it has an pressure altimeter that can be calibrated by the GPS measurements) and the map altitudes, but I have seen similar problems in paper maps as well.

e) Use with MetroGuide/CitySelect.  On the PC the change from one set of maps to another is just a pull down menu selection and the view changes (from Topo to Metroguide to CitySelect).  The region displayed, routes, and waypoints are kept.  It is fun to go back and forth and see what changes, but most of the changes are what I have seen on similar paper maps, allowing for the age differences.  Note that you cannot display both at the same time (e.g. display the Topo contours over the MetroGuide streets).  The display on the GPS unit is similar to the PC (but not in color on the Vista, a handicap).  However, changing which map to display requires checking or unchecking each map in the entire data set, you cannot simply select Topo or MetroGuide (this is particulr to the Vista).  So it is more time consuming than on the PC to change from driving to hiking navigation.  I guess that this is a trade of versitility and ease of use.  Incidentally, the only driving use that makes sense to me is when there is a human present at act as a navigator.  The display is just too hard to read while driving.",Good but there are some nagging issues,1120262400,26,

It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.

Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.

If I had it to do over again I would still buy TOPO USA because it works for me.","It is a basic tool, not a precise insturment.",1119657600,19,

The told me I need to use TOPO USA... I loaded the program, but it needed the CD, I found out in here how can I install so never ask for the CD. This is nasty! The trail detail is that it will give you a point! I hope at least the trail is crossing it! I am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point (Maybe its a vertical trail straight up?) I hate the map, I still like the GPS.

Don't buy this! Its a waste of money!!!!
